# Occupational Hazard
## A Discworld Tale

*In which Commander Sam Vimes discovers that Death has developed something of a following habit, the universe has a sense of humor that would make the gods weep, and some people are dying who really shouldn't be—while others who should be dying aren't.*

### Prologue

Ankh-Morpork was, generally speaking, the sort of city where the unexpected was less a possibility and more a scheduled municipal event, often listed somewhere near 'Guild of Seamstresses Annual Picnic' on the city calendar. Even so, some days managed to surprise everyone, particularly those whose job involved maintaining order when the very fabric of reality seemed to have mislaid its instructions.

The list arrived via the usual channels. Encrypted, of course, delivered with the quiet efficiency that defined the operation. No names, not in the conventional sense. Just designations. Targets. Irregularities.

Each entry was a stain on the cosmic ledger, a deviation from the scheduled flow of things. The killer's purpose was simple: restore order. Eliminate the anomalies. It wasn't personal. Personal implied emotion, and emotion was a variable that introduced unacceptable levels of unpredictability.

The methodology was chosen for efficiency and discretion. No pattern in the weapon or technique that a less... observant... authority might easily discern. A garrote – quick, silent, and easily disposed of. A swift thrust – a clean, professional termination that mimicked a violent accident. Poison – subtle, delayed, appearing as a relapse of a previous condition. Something direct – a knife, fitting for someone who dealt in sharp truths.

The employers appreciated efficiency. They valued procedure above all else. Life, in their view, was a process, a calculation, an entry in an infinite series of accounts. Death was simply the final audit. These individuals, by surviving their scheduled terminus, had introduced errors into the system. They were like rogue data points, corrupting the elegant simplicity of the universal algorithm.

The killer's role was the garbage collector. The error correction protocol. They weren't driven by malice, or greed, or any of the messy, irrational motivations that afflicted the majority of the sentient life they encountered. They were driven by purpose. By the quiet, internal satisfaction of restoring balance, of ensuring that the numbers added up.

There was a certain aesthetic to it, a clean precision that appealed to their nature. The world, left to its own chaotic devices, generated endless entropy. Their work was the opposite – the imposition of elegant, necessary finality.

The killer checked the time. The window for the next correction was opening. Subject Designation: Cripley, M. His location was confirmed. The method was prepared. Another anomaly to be erased. Another line item to be closed. Another step towards restoring the beautiful, uncomplicated order that the universe, in its sloppier moments, seemed determined to resist.

It was just a job. The most important job in existence, perhaps, but just a job all the same.

In the spaces between realities, entities that valued order above all else made careful notes in ledgers that would never be audited. The irregularities were being corrected, one by one. The system was being restored to its proper parameters.

Soon, the beautiful silence of perfect order would return.

### Chapter 1: The Uncomfortable Truth

The thing about murder scenes, Commander Sam Vimes reflected as he stood in the squalid room where Sarah Palmley had died, was that they had a way of making you ask uncomfortable questions about the nature of justice, the value of human life, and why some people seemed to die so bloody easily while others kept on breathing despite the universe's apparent best efforts.

The victim was Sarah Palmley, aged thirty-two, and she had died in her one-room tenement while her newborn baby slept in a drawer that served as a cot. The drawer was lined with old newspapers and what appeared to be the woman's only clean cloth.

What made this death particularly infuriating was not just that Sarah had been strangled with her own shawl—a piece of clothing so threadbare it was barely worthy of the name—but that she had been murdered sometime after giving birth to a healthy daughter. Someone had killed a new mother, which suggested either complete lack of conscience or something darker that Vimes preferred not to think about.

Vimes examined the scene with the sort of methodical attention that came from years of dealing with the aftermath of human cruelty. His gaze swept the squalid room, honed by years of seeing the worst of human cruelty. He settled first on the victim, then moved methodically—the angle of the shawl, the lack of disturbance, the single candle stub, carefully rationed.

The killer hadn't lingered—this was quick, efficient work that spoke of either professional skill or cold determination.

The room told the story of a life lived on society's margins. A single candle stub, carefully rationed. Clothes hanging on nails driven into the wall, each piece mended multiple times with thread that didn't quite match. A tin cup that served as both drinking vessel and cooking pot. The sort of poverty that wasn't just the absence of money, but the absence of hope that money would ever exist.

"She was working," Vimes observed, noting the pile of piecework sewing in the corner. "Trying to make enough to feed herself and the baby." He picked up one of the handkerchiefs she'd been sewing—fine work, despite everything.

"Professional job," he muttered, studying the evidence of deliberate, methodical murder. "Someone who knew exactly what they were doing." It was the same unnerving efficiency he'd seen in the recent deaths of Thomas Keel and Margaret Dowdy – clean, precise, and utterly devoid of passion.

The baby stirred in her newspaper-lined drawer, making the sort of small, helpless sounds that reminded you that some problems couldn't be solved with arrests or paperwork. The child was healthy, which was a miracle given the circumstances, but health wouldn't keep her fed or housed or alive in a city that treated poverty like a moral failing.

"Right then," he said to the empty room, but with the sort of grim determination that had made him the Watch's most effective Commander. "We're going to catch whoever killed Sarah Palmley. We're going to arrest them, and charge them, and make sure they spend a very long time thinking about what they've done."

As for the baby, Vimes reflected, Lady Sybil had been looking for a cause to champion. He suspected she was about to become very interested in affordable housing policy and the welfare of orphaned children.

Outside, the city continued its eternal business of being complicated and morally ambiguous, but inside the squalid room where Sarah Palmley had died, Commander Vimes was quietly planning to make someone's day considerably worse.

He was examining the shawl that had been used to strangle Sarah when the temperature in the room dropped several degrees. Not the sort of gradual cooling that came from an evening breeze, but the sudden, profound cold that suggested someone had opened a door between this world and somewhere considerably less hospitable.

COMMANDER VIMES.

Vimes didn't turn around immediately. In his experience, dramatic entrances worked better when you didn't give them your full attention right away. Instead, he continued studying the murder weapon, noting the professional way it had been twisted.

"Death," he said calmly. "I was wondering when you'd show up. Though I have to say, you're usually more punctual about these things."

I DID NOT COME FOR HER.

This made Vimes look up. Death stood in the doorway, his presence somehow making the small room feel even more cramped and squalid. But there was something unusual about his posture—an uncertainty that didn't fit with the normal confidence of an anthropomorphic personification going about his business.

"You didn't come for Sarah Palmley? She's definitely dead."

I KNOW. BUT I WAS NOT... SUMMONED.

"Summoned?"

WHEN SOMEONE DIES, I AM AWARE OF IT. I FEEL THE MOMENT OF TRANSITION. THERE IS A... PULL... THAT DRAWS ME TO GUIDE THEIR PASSAGE. Death examined the scene with what might have been professional interest. BUT WITH THIS WOMAN, THERE WAS NO SUMMONS. SHE DIED, BUT SOMETHING PREVENTED THE NORMAL PROCESS.

Vimes felt the familiar chill that came when a straightforward murder case started involving supernatural complications. "What sort of something?"

I DO NOT KNOW. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE. Death moved closer to examine Sarah's body with the sort of clinical attention that most people found disturbing. IN RECENT WEEKS, THERE HAVE BEEN... IRREGULARITIES. PEOPLE DYING WHO SHOULD NOT YET DIE, WITHOUT THE PROPER... PROTOCOLS.

"Protocols?"

THE NATURAL ORDER, COMMANDER. DEATH HAS PROCEDURES. SCHEDULES. WHEN SOMEONE'S TIME COMES, I AM THERE TO GUIDE THE TRANSITION. BUT THESE MURDERS... THEY ARE OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE PROPER CHANNELS.

Vimes studied Death with the sort of professional attention he usually reserved for witnesses who might be lying or telling the truth in ways that would make his life more complicated. "Are you telling me that someone is committing murders that even Death didn't see coming?"

PRECISELY. AND THAT, COMMANDER, IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING.

"Because?"

BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS SOMEONE HAS THE POWER TO INTERFERE WITH DEATH ITSELF. AND VERY FEW ENTITIES POSSESS SUCH AUTHORITY.

The baby stirred in her drawer, making small sounds that reminded them both that some problems required immediate practical solutions regardless of their cosmic implications.

"Right then," Vimes said, settling his thoughts into the sort of grim focus that had served him through decades of complicated cases. "Looks like we have a partner investigation. You handle the supernatural irregularities, I'll handle the criminal evidence. Between us, we might actually solve this thing."

I WOULD APPRECIATE THE ASSISTANCE, Death admitted. I FIND MYSELF... UNCERTAIN... ABOUT THE PROPER PROCEDURES FOR INVESTIGATING MY OWN PROFESSIONAL DISRUPTION.

"Don't worry about that," Vimes said, lighting a cigar. "I've been investigating impossible things for years. The trick is to treat them like regular crimes until they prove otherwise."

It was, he reflected, the kind of case that reminded him why he wore the badge: a mystery, a wrong to set right, and just enough strangeness to keep him sharp. Even if the boundaries of his job were getting stranger by the day.

### Chapter 2: The Pattern

The fourth murder scene was as baffling as the first three, with the added twist that Death was now examining evidence with a professional curiosity that suggested he was either learning new investigative techniques or developing worrying hobbies.

Commander Sam Vimes stood over the body of Marcus Cripley, a private investigator who made his living from other people's secrets—honest work, in its way, though it tended to create a remarkably diverse collection of individuals who might have strong opinions about your continued existence.

"Same killer," Vimes said, not needing confirmation but appreciating professional consensus. "Same technique, same efficiency, same complete lack of passion."

SAME ABSENCE OF PROPER PROTOCOLS, Death added, crouching beside the body with the sort of skeletal grace that came from never having to worry about joint pain. I WAS NOT SUMMONED FOR THIS ONE EITHER.

"So someone's murdering people in a way that bypasses Death himself," Vimes mused, lighting a cigar. "That's either very impressive or very stupid, depending on your perspective."

Captain Carrot arrived with his usual punctual efficiency, followed by Sergeant Angua, who immediately began examining the crime scene with the sort of focused attention that came from having senses considerably more acute than those possessed by normal humans.

"Commander," Carrot said, then stopped and stared at Death with the expression of someone whose training had covered many unusual situations but not specifically this one. He tilted his head slightly, studying the tall figure with obvious puzzlement. "I'm sorry, but... have we met? You seem very familiar. I'm Captain Carrot." He extended his hand in the sort of friendly, professional manner that had made him beloved by everyone from hardened criminals to elderly shopkeepers.

GOOD MORNING, CAPTAIN CARROT. I AM... ASSISTING WITH THE INVESTIGATION, Death replied, regarding the offered hand with what might have been uncertainty before carefully shaking it.

"Right, of course. Thank you for your assistance, Mr...?" Carrot waited expectantly, his pen poised over his notebook in the way that suggested he was preparing to add another name to his mental directory of everyone in Ankh-Morpork.

MR... FINAL, Death said after a pause that suggested he was unfamiliar with the concept of aliases. MR. MORT FINAL.

"Mr. Final," Carrot repeated, writing carefully in his notebook. "And you're here in what capacity exactly? Are you with the Guild of... Doctors? Morticians?" He looked up with the sort of earnest interest that suggested he genuinely wanted to understand everyone's professional background.

I AM... A CONSULTANT. SPECIALIZING IN... TRANSITION MANAGEMENT.

"Right. Of course." Carrot consulted his notebook with the sort of professional adaptability that had made him the Watch's most reliable officer, though he continued to glance at Death with that puzzled expression of someone trying to remember where they'd seen a face before. "What do we know about the connection between the victims?"

"They all survived things that should have killed them," Vimes said. "Sarah Palmley survived a difficult childbirth. Thomas Keel walked away from a carriage accident. Margaret Dowdy recovered from consumption. And Marcus here was investigating insurance fraud cases involving people who'd had similar experiences."

"People who nearly died but didn't," Angua added, her nose twitching as she followed a scent trail around the room. "Someone's tracking people who've cheated death, then killing them."

THEY DID NOT CHEAT DEATH, Death said with the sort of precision that suggested professional standards were at stake. THEY SURVIVED ACCORDING TO THE NATURAL ORDER. THEIR TIME HAD NOT YET COME. Death examined the murder weapon with interest. BUT SOMEONE IS ELIMINATING THEM BEFORE THEIR PROPER TIME, WHICH CREATES... IRREGULARITIES.

"What sort of irregularities?" Carrot asked.

COSMIC ONES. WHEN SOMEONE DIES OUTSIDE THE PROPER SCHEDULE, IT AFFECTS THE BALANCE OF THINGS. REALITY BECOMES... LESS STABLE.

Angua paused in her scent tracking. "Commander, there's something else. The same chemical signature from the other crime scenes, but stronger. And there's something..." she concentrated, "...something that smells like paperwork. Bureaucracy. The sort of administrative smell you get in government offices."

"Paperwork?" Vimes asked.

"Rubber stamps, filing cabinets, that particular blend of ink and disappointment that suggests forms being filled out in triplicate."

Death appeared thoughtful. THERE ARE ENTITIES THAT TREAT EXISTENCE AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEM.

"What kind of entities?"

THE KIND THAT VALUE ORDER ABOVE LIFE, EFFICIENCY ABOVE COMPASSION. THE KIND THAT WOULD CONSIDER UNAUTHORIZED SURVIVAL TO BE A FILING ERROR REQUIRING CORRECTION.

Vimes felt the familiar chill that came when a case shifted from merely complicated to potentially catastrophic. "Are you telling me that cosmic bureaucrats are hiring assassins to kill people for not dying on schedule?"

THAT WOULD BE... CONSISTENT WITH RECENT EVENTS.

"Right then," Vimes said, settling into the sort of grim determination that had served him through decades of complicated cases. "Carrot, I want you to start compiling information about all four victims. Look for who might have access to their medical records, accident reports, anything that would tell someone about their near-death experiences. Angua, follow that bureaucratic scent. See where it leads."

"What about you, Commander?" Carrot asked.

"Death and I are going to have a conversation about cosmic entities who think murder is a quality control measure. And then we're going to arrest them."

I BELIEVE THAT MAY BE MORE COMPLICATED THAN USUAL POLICE PROCEDURES, Death observed.

"Probably," Vimes agreed. "But the principle's the same. Someone's committing murder in my city, which makes it my problem. The fact that they're doing it for cosmic reasons just means we'll need different paperwork."

Some days, he reflected, being a policeman in Ankh-Morpork required considerable flexibility in one's definition of jurisdiction.

### Chapter 3: The Pattern Emerges

Commander Vimes sat in his office at the Watch House, surrounded by the sort of paperwork that made violent crime seem like a relaxing hobby. Four case files lay open on his desk, each one representing what should have been a straightforward murder investigation. The fact that Death was now involved as a consulting detective suggested that straightforward had left the building some time ago, probably taking reasonable and predictable with it.

He lit a cigar and reviewed the timeline that was becoming disturbingly clear.

Thomas Keel had been the first. A carpenter, sixty-three years old, who'd been crossing Broad Way when a nobleman's carriage had taken the corner too fast. The horses had trampled him, the wheels had run over his chest, and by all accounts he should have been dead before the Watch arrived. Instead, he'd stood up, dusted himself off, and walked home with nothing more than a few bruises and a story that made him popular in taverns for the better part of a week.

Three days later, someone had visited Thomas in his workshop. The killer had used a knife—professional work, precise placement between the ribs. The sort of wound that suggested either medical training or considerable experience in ending lives efficiently. No signs of struggle, no evidence of robbery. Thomas had been found the next morning by his apprentice, tools still laid out for the day's work.

Vimes had investigated personally, of course. The scene had been clean, almost clinical. No fingerprints, no witnesses, no obvious motive. Thomas had been well-liked, paid his taxes, caused no trouble for anyone. The sort of man who lived quietly and died for no reason anyone could identify.

Except, as it turned out, there was a reason. Thomas had survived something that should have killed him.

Margaret Dowdy had been next. A seamstress who worked from her small apartment near the Shades, taking in mending and alterations to support herself and her elderly mother. She'd been dying of consumption for the better part of two years—the sort of slow, inevitable decline that claimed people regularly in that part of the city. The Guild of Doctors had given up on her months ago, and even the priests had started making those careful visits that suggested preparation for final arrangements.

Then, quite suddenly, she'd recovered. Not improved—recovered. The cough disappeared, her color returned, her strength came back as if the disease had simply decided to find someone else to torment. Dr. Lawn had examined her personally and declared it the most complete recovery from advanced consumption he'd seen in thirty years of practice.

Four days later, Margaret had died in her sleep. Poisoned, as it turned out, with something so subtle that it had taken Cheery three attempts to identify it. A compound that mimicked the symptoms of consumption relapse—the sort of thing that would have looked like natural causes if anyone hadn't been paying particularly close attention.

But Vimes had been paying attention, because by then he'd started to notice the pattern.

Two people, both of whom had survived things that should have killed them. Both murdered within days of their miraculous recoveries, using methods that suggested professional skill and careful planning. The sort of murders that were meant to look like accidents or natural causes, committed by someone who understood exactly what they were doing.

Sarah Palmley had been the third. Difficult childbirth, survived against all odds, murdered three days later. And now Marcus Cripley, who'd been investigating insurance fraud cases involving people with similar experiences. Four murders, four people who'd cheated death, and now Death himself was asking for help investigating his own professional disruption.

Vimes stubbed out his cigar and studied the evidence board that Carrot had prepared with military precision. The pattern was becoming clear—someone was systematically eliminating people who'd survived things that should have killed them. The question was who, and more importantly, why.

Outside his office, he could hear the familiar sounds of the Watch House going about its business. Constables filing reports, suspects being processed, the endless bureaucracy of law enforcement grinding forward with reassuring efficiency. Normal crime, normal procedures, normal problems that could be solved with arrests and paperwork.

But this case was different. It was the kind of case that reminded him why he'd become a policeman in the first place—not for the easy answers, but for the complicated questions that needed someone stubborn enough to keep asking them until the truth came out.

He reached for his badge, and headed for the door. Time to gather his officers and see what they'd learned. Time to find out who was murdering people for the crime of staying alive, and put them somewhere they could think about the error of their ways for a very long time.

It was, he reflected, exactly the sort of impossible case that made police work interesting. Even if he could do without Death as a consulting detective.

### Chapter 4: The Investigation

Vimes gathered his officers in the main office of the Watch House, which had been cleared of wedding planning materials and returned to its more familiar state of organized chaos. Death sat in one of the visitor's chairs with the sort of stillness that suggested he was either deep in thought or had temporarily forgotten how to exist. Captain Carrot had prepared a detailed summary of the case with the sort of methodical thoroughness that made hardened criminals confess to things they hadn't even thought of doing yet, while Sergeant Colon had contributed a pot of coffee strong enough to wake the dead and possibly offer them employment opportunities.

The presence of Death had created what Vimes privately thought of as "an interesting dynamic" among his officers. Cheery kept glancing at him with the sort of professional curiosity that suggested she was wondering about the forensic applications of skeletal anatomy. Nobby seemed disappointed that Death wasn't wearing a more dramatic costume. And Sergeant Colon kept offering him tea, apparently under the impression that Death might be cold.

"Right then," Vimes said, studying the evidence board that Cheery had constructed with military precision. "Four murders in four days. All people who survived things that should have killed them. Someone's cleaning house, and we're going to find out who."

The evidence board was a masterpiece of investigative organization. Photographs of the victims were arranged in chronological order, connected by red string to locations, potential motives, and known associates. Maps showed the locations of each murder, marked with different colored pins that indicated time of death, method of killing, and proximity to various civic institutions. The overall effect was less "police investigation" and more "military campaign planning," which was probably appropriate given the systematic nature of the crimes.

"What do we know about the killer?" Vimes asked.

"Professional," Angua said immediately. "Clean kills, no unnecessary violence, no sexual motivation. This is someone who treats murder like a job."

"Someone with access to information about people's near-death experiences," Carrot added. "They knew exactly who had survived things that should have killed them."

"And someone with resources," Cheery contributed. "The weapons were different each time - knife, poison, garrote, blunt instrument. Either they have a large collection, or they can acquire whatever they need for each specific job."

SOMEONE WHO OPERATES OUTSIDE THE NORMAL CHANNELS OF MORTALITY, Death added. THE MURDERS CREATE NO RIPPLES IN THE COSMIC ORDER, NO DISTURBANCE IN THE NATURAL FLOW OF THINGS. WHICH SUGGESTS THEY ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY ENTITIES THAT UNDERSTAND HOW TO... CIRCUMVENT... NORMAL PROCESSES.

Nobby raised his hand. "Also, someone who doesn't like weddings very much."

"Why do you say that, Nobby?" Vimes asked, though he suspected he was going to regret the question.

"Well, three of the four victims were connected to wedding celebrations. Sarah Palmley was killed right after having a baby - that's like a wedding for babies, isn't it? And Thomas Keel was meant to die on his way to his nephew's ceremony. And Marcus Cripley was investigating insurance fraud at wedding venues."

There was a pause while everyone considered this. It was, Vimes reflected, either completely stupid or remarkably insightful. With Nobby, the distinction was often less clear than one might expect.

"Actually," Carrot said slowly, "that's not entirely unreasonable. If someone's targeting people Death saved during happy occasions..."

"Then they might have something against happiness in general," Angua finished. "Or against things that disrupt their idea of proper order."

"Right then. Nobby, Colon - I want you to canvas the neighborhoods where the victims lived. Talk to people, find out if anyone saw anything unusual. Be polite. Be official. Be the sort of polite and official that makes people want to help."

"Can I wear my dress?" Nobby asked hopefully.

"No dresses, Nobby."

"What about a nice suit?"

"You can wear your dress uniform and look respectable for once in your career."

"Carrot, Angua - I want you to visit the places where these people had their near-death experiences. Sarah's tenement where she gave birth, the street where Thomas had his accident. See if anything connects them."

"And me, Commander?" Cheery asked.

"You're going to do what you do best, Cheery. Go through the forensic evidence and tell me things I haven't thought to ask about."

As his officers dispersed to their various tasks, Vimes felt a grim satisfaction settle in his gut. Suspects, motives, evidence. No cosmic entities, no bloody philosophy.

It was, he thought, almost relaxing.

### Chapter 5: The Evidence

Cheery Littlebottom sat in the Watch House basement surrounded by the sort of scientific equipment that would have impressed the Faculty of Practical Magic at Unseen University, if the wizards had been capable of thinking about anything more practical than whose turn it was to feed the Library's more carnivorous books[^rincewind]. The basement served as both forensic laboratory and general storage area for things that were too dangerous to keep upstairs but too valuable to throw away, which created an interesting working environment that combined cutting-edge investigative techniques with the constant possibility of accidental poisoning.

The walls were lined with shelves containing evidence from hundreds of cases: bottled samples of suspicious substances, preserved fingerprints, weapons that had been catalogued and stored for future reference, and an impressive collection of what Cheery professionally referred to as "interesting stains." Gas lamps provided steady illumination, supplemented by the sort of specialized lighting equipment that allowed for detailed examination of evidence that preferred not to be examined in detail.

Cheery looked up from her evidence with the sort of expression that suggested she'd found something both disturbing and illuminating.

"Right," she said without preamble. "Our killer's been making mistakes. Expensive mistakes."

The laboratory door opened and Captain Carrot descended the stairs, followed by Sergeant Angua, both of them carrying the sort of expressions that suggested their afternoon had been educational in ways they hadn't entirely expected.

"Any luck with the wedding venues?" Cheery asked.

"We've visited all the locations where our victims had their near-death experiences," Carrot said. "And Marcus Cripley was investigating insurance fraud cases - people who stage near-death experiences to collect on policies."

"But our victims weren't part of any fraud," Angua added. "Most of them couldn't even afford insurance. They just survived genuine life-threatening situations when they shouldn't have."

"That explains the silk fibers," Cheery said, producing a vial. "Expensive silk, contaminated with preservation chemicals and something else—insurance documentation ink. Our killer works in the insurance industry and has access to professional preservation equipment."

Angua's nose twitched. "That would explain the strange scent I detected at the crime scene. Something chemical, but not quite human."

"Exactly. Our killer has access to unusual preservatives, which narrows our suspect list considerably."

The laboratory door opened again, and Sergeant Colon descended the stairs with Nobby Nobbs trailing behind, both of them looking slightly confused.

"Afternoon, all," Colon said. "We've been canvassing the neighborhoods like you asked, Commander."

"Find anything interesting?" Angua asked.

"Well," Nobby consulted his notebook, "people keep mentioning strange smells around the time of the murders. Chemical smells. And someone in a professional-looking outfit who didn't seem quite... right."

"Not quite right how?"

"Hard to say. Just... too formal. Too neat. Like someone playing a role rather than actually being what they appeared to be."

Cheery nodded. "That fits with what we've found here. Our killer is definitely a professional - someone who treats murder like a technical problem to be solved."

"Any evidence pointing to specific individuals?"

"Actually, yes." Cheery produced a small glass vial containing what appeared to be ordinary dust. "This is residue from the murder weapon used to kill Thomas Keel. It contains traces of a very specific type of preservative that's quite rare."

"What kind of preservative?"

"The kind used by... collectors. People who preserve things that are meant to last indefinitely."

There was a moment of silence as everyone considered the implications.

"So," Carrot said slowly, "we have a killer who uses professional-grade preservation chemicals, works with methodical precision, and specifically targets people who've cheated death."

"Someone who considers survival to be an error that needs correcting," Angua added.

"Right then," Colon said. "I think we need to talk to the Commander about this. This is getting into territory that's above our pay grade."

As they prepared to leave the laboratory, Cheery reflected that there was something deeply satisfying about good forensic work. No supernatural intervention required, no cosmic entities needed - just careful observation, scientific method, and the sort of attention to detail that criminals always underestimated.

It was, she thought, proper police work at its finest.

### Chapter 6: Quality Control

The methodical review of completed assignments was a necessity that distinguished professional work from amateur enthusiasm. Each case file was examined with the sort of careful attention that might have impressed the Guild of Accountants, if members of that organization had been capable of contemplating activities more hazardous than tax assessment.

The workspace was precise, organized according to principles that valued efficiency above comfort. Maps of the city covered one wall, marked with pins of various colors indicating locations of interest, timing considerations, and potential complications. A second wall displayed what might have been called a organizational chart, though the relationships it depicted were unlikely to be found in any conventional business manual.

The killer sat at a desk that might have belonged to any middle-level bureaucrat—solid wood, clean lines, everything in its proper place. The only unusual feature was the locked cabinet that contained specialized equipment arranged with the sort of care typically reserved for surgical instruments or particularly valuable wines.

*Assignment Review: S. Palmley*
*Method: Strangulation using available materials*
*Complications: Minimal. Subject was alone, infant posed no operational difficulties*
*Efficiency Rating: Satisfactory*
*Time to Completion: 7 minutes*
*Cleanup Requirements: Standard protocols*

The killer made notes in a precise hand, documenting details that would be of interest to certain parties who valued thoroughness in their service providers. The work was evaluated not for emotional satisfaction—emotion being a variable that introduced unacceptable unpredictability—but for technical excellence and adherence to specifications.

*Assignment Review: T. Keel*
*Method: Blade work, precision placement*
*Complications: Subject demonstrated unexpected awareness, requiring adaptation*
*Efficiency Rating: Adequate*
*Time to Completion: 12 minutes*
*Cleanup Requirements: Enhanced protocols due to location factors*

Each case presented its own technical challenges. The art lay in adapting standardized procedures to specific circumstances while maintaining the sort of professional standards that their employers had come to expect. It was skilled work, requiring not just technical competence but an understanding of larger operational objectives.

*Assignment Review: M. Cripley*
*Method: Blunt instrument, staged to appear accidental*
*Complications: Subject's investigative background required enhanced cleanup protocols*  
*Efficiency Rating: Satisfactory*
*Time to Completion: 15 minutes*
*Cleanup Requirements: Standard protocols plus document removal*

The private investigator had presented unique challenges. Someone who made their living from discovering other people's secrets had possessed the sort of professional paranoia that required careful planning. The irony had not been lost on the killer—Cripley had spent his career uncovering dangerous truths, only to discover that some secrets were more dangerous than others.

A soft chime indicated an incoming communication. The killer activated the mechanism with the sort of practiced efficiency that suggested regular use.

*New parameters confirmed. Continue current operational timeline. Additional assignments to follow pending completion of current objectives. Maintain discretion protocols. Efficiency levels satisfactory but improvement expected.*

The message self-destructed with a small puff of smoke that smelled faintly of sulfur and bureaucracy. The killer made a note in the margin of their planning documents: *Employer expectations elevated. Adjust quality standards accordingly.*

This was the sort of work that required dedication to craft. Each assignment was a problem to be solved, a technical challenge that demanded both precision and creativity. The goal was not just completion but completion to a standard that would satisfy entities whose standards were... elevated.

The killer stood and moved to the equipment cabinet, selecting items appropriate for the next assignment. A small blade—sharp enough to be effective, common enough to be untraceable. A vial of substance that would assist with cleanup procedures. A length of cord that could serve multiple purposes, depending on circumstances.

The work was, in its way, a form of art. The art of correction. The restoration of proper order in a universe that seemed increasingly determined to generate irregularities. Each assignment brought the world closer to the beautiful simplicity that their employers valued above all else.

It was honest work. Important work. The sort of work that made the universe function according to its proper parameters.

Four assignments completed. Four irregularities corrected. The system was functioning with acceptable efficiency levels.

The killer filed the completed reports and began reviewing the next phase of operations.

### Chapter 7: The Breakfast Incident

Commander Vimes sat in Harga's House of Ribs, which occupied a special place in Ankh-Morpork's culinary ecosystem somewhere between "restaurant" and "biological warfare facility." The establishment had earned its reputation through a combination of aggressive pricing, mysterious ingredients, and the sort of robust approach to food safety that assumed anyone weak enough to be poisoned by breakfast probably wasn't cut out for life in the big city anyway.

The House of Ribs was located in a narrow building that leaned against its neighbors for support, much like its clientele. The windows were yellow with grease and decades of accumulated cooking smoke, which filtered the morning light into a golden haze that made everything look slightly more appetizing than it actually was. This was probably intentional. The air inside was thick enough to chew, heavy with the scents of frying meat, burnt coffee, and something that might have been bacon if bacon could be weaponized.

Vimes sat in his usual booth—scarred wood that had witnessed more confessions than most priest holes—reading his copy of the Ankh-Morpork Times while working his way through what Harga optimistically advertised as a "Full Breakfast." The meal consisted of items that had once, in their natural state, probably resembled food. The eggs had clearly led interesting lives before arriving on his plate, the bacon exhibited a structural integrity that suggested it could be used for light construction work, and the sausages had achieved a color not normally found in nature outside of certain tropical warning systems.

Vimes liked Harga's because it was honest about what it was—a place where you could get breakfast that would either kill you or make you strong enough to survive whatever the day had planned for you. Either way, you knew where you stood, which was more than could be said for most of Ankh-Morpork's civic institutions.

He was contemplating an object that Harga claimed was a grilled tomato but which bore a suspicious resemblance to something that might explode under pressure, when the morning light seemed to dim slightly. This wasn't unusual in Ankh-Morpork, where the light was regularly dimmed by everything from industrial smoke to localized weather phenomena to the occasional dragon, but this particular dimming had a quality that suggested metaphysical rather than meteorological causes.

A familiar figure settled into the booth across from him with the sort of fluid motion that belonged to someone who didn't need to worry about the normal constraints of anatomy.

GOOD MORNING, COMMANDER.

"Death." Vimes didn't look up from his newspaper, which was running its usual mixture of political scandal, unexplained disappearances, and a surprisingly optimistic piece about a local merchant's plan to introduce "customer service" to Ankh-Morpork retail. The last item was filed under "Lifestyle" rather than "Comedy," which showed either remarkable editorial restraint or a complete lack of understanding about local economic conditions. "Bit early for you, isn't it? Don't you usually work the night shift, like burglars and other professionals?"

Death considered this question with the sort of careful attention most people reserved for mathematical theorems or their tax returns. I WORK ALL HOURS, ACTUALLY. DEATH DOESN'T KEEP REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS. THE UNIVERSE OPERATES ON A TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR SCHEDULE, BUT MORTALITY TENDS TO BE MORE... OPPORTUNISTIC.

"Right. Well, if you're here for Harga, you might want to wait. Pretty sure his cooking is going to finish the job eventually. Save you the trip." Vimes gestured at his plate with his fork, which had acquired a slight bend from wrestling with the bacon. "Though I suppose that would be death by natural causes. Or possibly death by unnatural causes, depending on what he's using for preservatives."

I AM NOT HERE ON BUSINESS.

This time Vimes did look up from his newspaper. Death was sitting perfectly still, skeletal hands folded on the table with the sort of precision that suggested either meditation or rigor mortis. His eye sockets seemed fixed intently on Vimes.

The sight was somewhat unnerving, partly because Death wasn't usually someone who waited for things. In the normal course of events, things waited for Death—usually while trying to run away, bargain for more time, or complete their tax returns. The idea of Death as a customer rather than a service provider suggested either a fundamental shift in the cosmic order or possibly just a very slow morning in the mortality business.

"Social call again?" Vimes asked, spearing something that might have been an egg, though it exhibited a suspicious resilience that suggested it had been fortified with materials not normally associated with poultry. "This is getting to be a habit."

HABITS ARE INTERESTING THINGS, Death observed with the sort of philosophical air that suggested he'd been giving the matter considerable thought. THEY PROVIDE STRUCTURE TO EXISTENCE. THEY CREATE PREDICTABILITY IN AN UNPREDICTABLE UNIVERSE. THEY ALLOW MORTALS TO FUNCTION WITHOUT HAVING TO CONSCIOUSLY DECIDE WHETHER TO CONTINUE BREATHING EVERY FEW SECONDS.

"That's true," Vimes agreed, though he suspected Death's understanding of habits might be slightly different from the average person's. "My habit is trying to keep this city from falling apart completely. What's yours?"

DEATH IS NOT A HABIT. IT IS MORE OF A... CALLING. THOUGH I SUPPOSE ONE COULD ARGUE THAT ETERNAL EXISTENCE CREATES ITS OWN PATTERNS. THERE IS A CERTAIN RHYTHM TO MORTALITY THAT BECOMES... FAMILIAR.

"Right." Vimes chewed thoughtfully, noting that the mysterious breakfast item had the texture of something that could probably survive a small explosion. "So what brings you to breakfast? And please tell me you're not here to discuss my cholesterol levels. Lady Sybil already covers that topic thoroughly, with charts."

I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR DAILY ROUTINE.

"My routine?" Vimes raised an eyebrow, causing a small crease to appear in his forehead that had been worn there by years of dealing with municipal bureaucracy and criminal creativity. "It's not that interesting. Get up, try to prevent the city from burning down, go home, repeat. Occasionally there are riots, but those are usually scheduled in advance by the Guild of Rioters. Very professional organization, actually. They file proper paperwork and everything."

BUT YOU APPROACH EACH DAY AS IF IT MATTERS.

The observation hung in the air between them like incense, heavy with implications that neither of them was quite ready to examine too closely.

"Well, yes. Because it does. Every day matters. That's the point." Vimes looked up from his breakfast, meeting Death's gaze directly in the way that most people found difficult and many found impossible. "If you don't act like today matters, you end up with a tomorrow that's worse than yesterday. Simple mathematics, really."

Death appeared to be thinking about this, which was somewhat unnerving. Death thinking was like watching someone juggle live grenades—fascinating in an intellectual sense, but suggesting the possibility of consequences that extended well beyond the immediate vicinity.

MOST PEOPLE SPEND THEIR LIVES PREPARING TO LIVE, Death observed, in the tone of someone who had been making notes.

"Most people are idiots," Vimes said cheerfully, attacking what appeared to be a sausage but might have been a small cylindrical building material. "Present company excepted, of course."

OF COURSE.

There was a comfortable silence, broken only by the sounds of other customers bravely tackling Harga's interpretation of morning nutrition. The restaurant's usual clientele consisted primarily of people whose relationship with food was based more on necessity than pleasure: night-shift workers heading home, day-shift workers summoning courage for the hours ahead, and the occasional tourist who had mistaken adventurous eating for actual adventure and was now learning the difference.

Vimes finished his breakfast with the sort of methodical determination that suggested either genuine hunger or a commitment to getting his money's worth. He stood to leave, noting that Death remained seated with the stillness of someone who either had nowhere else to be or was contemplating questions that didn't have easy answers.

"Well, this has been... educational. But I've got a city to police." Vimes folded his newspaper under his arm, the morning's headlines already becoming yesterday's problems. "Crime doesn't take breakfast breaks, unfortunately. More's the pity."

Death nodded with what might have been understanding. UNTIL NEXT TIME, COMMANDER.

"Next time?" But Death was already gone, leaving behind only the faint scent of desert winds and old libraries, and the nagging feeling that Vimes was missing something important. The spot where Death had been sitting showed no sign of recent occupation except for a slight coolness in the air and the distinct impression that something fundamental had shifted in the cosmic order.

Vimes paid Harga—who accepted the money with the sort of professional gratitude that suggested he understood the courage required to eat his cooking—and left a tip that was more superstition than service. In Ankh-Morpork, it was generally considered wise to stay on the good side of anyone who handled your food, especially if their definition of "food" was somewhat broader than most people's.

He headed toward the Watch House, unconsciously falling into the measured pace that had carried him through decades of police work.

### Chapter 8: The Patrol

Vimes was on his rounds through the Shades, which was Ankh-Morpork's most honest neighborhood in the sense that everyone there was a criminal and didn't pretend otherwise. It was refreshing, in a way that could only be appreciated by someone who spent most of his working life dealing with people who stole money and called it taxation, or who murdered people and called it politics.

The Shades occupied a special place in Ankh-Morpork's geography—not just physical, but moral and philosophical as well. It was the sort of area that maps marked with the notation "Here Be Monsters," except that the monsters were generally more reasonable than the residents. The buildings leaned against each other for support, much like their inhabitants, and the streets followed the sort of logic that suggested they had been laid out by someone who had never heard of straight lines and considered them a dangerous foreign innovation.

During the day, the Shades maintained a certain shabby dignity, like a retired general who had seen better times but still insisted on wearing his medals. At night, however, it transformed into something altogether more primal. The darkness here was not just the absence of light but the presence of something else entirely—a quality of shadow that seemed to have weight and intention. It was the sort of darkness that made even experienced criminals check over their shoulders and walk a little faster.

Vimes, being neither sensible nor foolish but something else entirely—professional, perhaps, or possibly just too stubborn to admit that anything could frighten him after thirty years of police work—walked through these streets with the confidence of a man who had seen worse things than dark alleys filled with cutthroats. This was partly because he had, in fact, seen worse things, and partly because his reputation preceded him in ways that made most criminals decide they had urgent business elsewhere.

He had just finished explaining to a would-be mugger why attempting to rob the Commander of the City Watch was both a career-limiting move and a fundamental misunderstanding of the local power structure, when Death appeared at his elbow with the sort of casual materialization that suggested either considerable magical ability or a complete disregard for the normal laws of physics.

GOOD EVENING, COMMANDER. INTERESTING TECHNIQUE.

"Death." Vimes straightened his armor and continued walking, his boots echoing off the damp cobblestones with the sort of measured rhythm that had become as familiar to the Shades' residents as the city's bells. Death walked beside him, his gaze steady.

I AM NOT CONCERNED WITH GOSSIP.

"No, I suppose you wouldn't be. Hard to damage the reputation of the inevitable." Vimes turned down Scandal Alley, which had earned its name through a combination of historical incidents and the sort of ongoing activities that made it unsuitable for family entertainment. He noted with professional interest that someone had improved the lighting—probably the local Thieves' Guild chapter, since good visibility was essential for quality muggings. Poor lighting led to embarrassing mistakes, such as attempting to rob people who were both armed and professional about violence.

YOU SEEM REMARKABLY CALM ABOUT MY PRESENCE.

"Should I be worried? Are you here in a professional capacity this time?"

NOT... EXACTLY.

"That's reassuring. Sort of." Vimes paused to help an elderly woman who had been relieved of her purse by a young entrepreneur. The purse was returned with a lecture on the economics of crime that left the thief looking confused and oddly educated.

I AM IMPRESSED BY YOUR... METHODOLOGY, Death observed as they continued their patrol.

"What methodology? I just do the job."

EXACTLY. Death seemed pleased by this response, which was somehow more disturbing than if he had seemed displeased.

They walked in companionable silence through the twisted streets, which seemed to rearrange themselves slightly when no one was looking—a common phenomenon in this part of the city, where the architecture had developed a certain creative independence over the centuries. Death's presence had an oddly calming effect on the local criminal element, though not in the way one might expect. Rather than fleeing in terror, the various practitioners of unofficial economics seemed to take his appearance as a sign that they should perhaps consider taking up safer professions. Burglars decided to call it an early night and spend quality time with their families. Pickpockets found themselves suddenly interested in honest work, or at least work that didn't involve personal contact with potential victims. Even the gargoyles looked nervous, which was remarkable given that they were generally considered to be among the city's more stoic residents.

"You know," Vimes said as they emerged onto Broad Way, which was broader than most streets in the Shades but still considerably narrower than its name suggested, "this is either the most surreal evening of my career, or I'm having some sort of breakdown. Either way, it's been educational." He paused to light a cigar, noting that the flame seemed steadier in Death's presence, as if even fire recognized something fundamental about his companion.

They paused outside a well-lit mansion where the sounds of a well-bred social gathering drifted through the windows like music played on instruments made of good breeding and old money. The contrast between the refined merriment inside and the gritty reality of the Shades outside was so stark it was almost philosophical.

I ASSUME THAT IS YOUR HOME?

"God, no. That's the Rust place. I live over there." Vimes pointed to a more modest but well-maintained building. "Lady Sybil will be wondering where I am. She's probably got Willikins watching for me with the good telescope."

WILLIKINS?

"The butler. Used to be quite handy with a knife, back in the day. Now he's handy with afternoon tea and tactical domestic management. Amazing what a good butler can do with a silver service and a properly threatening manner."

I HAVE MET FEW BUTLERS IN MY LINE OF WORK.

"That's because Willikins doesn't let people die in his house. Bad for the silverware, apparently. Says it's unprofessional."

I FIND YOUR COMPANY... AGREEABLE, Death admitted. YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE ON MORTALITY.

"Well, you seem like a reasonable sort of anthropomorphic personification. Professional, too. I respect that. Besides, if I worried about every supernatural entity that wandered through my life, I'd never get any sleep. Last week Lord Vetinari sent me a note asking about my health. I wasn't ill."

THE PATRICIAN HAS HIS OWN RELATIONSHIP WITH INEVITABILITY.

"Don't they all." Vimes checked his watch. "Speaking of inevitability, I should get home before Lady Sybil sends out a search party. She's got contacts in the Assassins' Guild, and they're very thorough."

Death appeared gratified by this assessment.

UNTIL TOMORROW, COMMANDER.

"Tomorrow?" But Death was gone again, leaving Vimes alone with the growing certainty that something very strange was happening, and that he was probably the last person in the city to figure out what it was.

### Chapter 9: The Visitor

The appointment was kept precisely at midnight, as all the best appointments were. Midnight had the advantage of being the sort of time when sensible people were asleep, which left the night free for those whose business required privacy, discretion, and the absence of witnesses.

The meeting place was unremarkable—a small office above a respectable import business that dealt in spices, silk, and the occasional item that customs officials preferred not to examine too closely. The sort of establishment that had been in business for generations and had developed a reputation for asking very few questions about the nature of its transactions.

The office itself was furnished in the style of someone who understood that true luxury lay not in ostentation but in quality. The desk was solid oak, the chairs were upholstered in leather that had been properly cared for, and the filing cabinets were made of the sort of steel that suggested their contents were worth protecting. It was the office of someone who dealt in matters of importance, though what those matters might be was not immediately apparent from the décor.

The figure behind the desk made notes in a ledger with the sort of precise handwriting that suggested both excellent education and considerable attention to detail. The entries were made in a code that would have been meaningless to most observers, though certain members of various professional guilds might have found them quite informative.

*S. Palmley - Contract completed as specified. Payment rendered. Client satisfaction confirmed.*

*T. Keel - Delayed execution resolved. Natural terminus restored. Billing pending review.*

*M. Dowdy - Irregularity corrected. Documentation filed. Awaiting further instructions.*

A soft knock at the door interrupted this administrative work. The figure looked up, checked a pocket watch, and nodded with satisfaction. Promptness was a virtue too often neglected in modern business relationships.

"Enter."

The visitor who stepped through the door was the sort of person who might have been anyone, which was precisely the point. Average height, unremarkable features, the kind of face that blended seamlessly into crowds and was forgotten as soon as the observer looked away. They wore the sort of clothes that suggested middle-class respectability without drawing attention to themselves—a skill that required considerable practice to master.

"The arrangements are proceeding as discussed," the visitor reported, settling into the chair across from the desk. "Though there have been... complications."

"Complications are to be expected when dealing with cosmic irregularities. Please elaborate."

"The subject has begun forming personal attachments. This was not anticipated in the original parameters."

The figure behind the desk made a note in the margin of the ledger. "Attachments to whom?"

"Various residents of the city. The Watch Commander appears to be of particular interest. There have been several documented interactions that suggest something approaching... friendship."

This information was received with the sort of calm attention that suggested it was both surprising and important. "I see. And the impact on our operational timeline?"

"Minimal, thus far. The primary objectives remain achievable. However, these attachments may complicate the final resolution of the situation."

"In what way?"

"Sentiment has historically proven to be a significant factor in decision-making processes. If the subject has developed emotional investments in the outcome, rational calculation becomes unreliable."

The figure nodded thoughtfully. "This was always a possibility. We have contingency plans for various forms of interference. Are you prepared to implement them if necessary?"

"Of course. Though I should note that certain aspects of the situation may require... creative solutions."

"Creativity is why we selected you for this assignment. Your reputation for innovative problem-solving preceded you."

The visitor acknowledged this compliment with a slight inclination of the head. "When do you anticipate moving to the final phase?"

"Soon. The current disruptions cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. There are... other parties... who have begun to take notice. Questions are being asked that would be better left unasked."

"And if those questions lead to answers?"

"Then we will ensure that the individuals asking them are no longer in a position to share their discoveries." The figure closed the ledger and locked it in a drawer of the desk. "Your services have been most satisfactory thus far. I trust they will continue to be so."

The visitor stood, understanding that the meeting was concluded. "Of course. Though I should mention—there may be additional expenses associated with the final phase. The situation has evolved beyond the original scope of the contract."

"Expense is not a concern. Results are the only consideration."

The visitor nodded and moved toward the door, then paused. "One question, if I may. The subject—why is it so important that the situation be resolved? The current irregularities seem relatively minor in the grand scheme of things."

The figure behind the desk was quiet for a long moment, considering whether to answer. "Because, my dear colleague, minor irregularities have a tendency to become major problems if left unchecked. And major problems require major solutions, which tend to be... expensive... and attract unwanted attention."

"I understand."

"I'm certain you do. Until our next meeting, then."

The visitor left as quietly as they had arrived, and the office returned to its state of midnight silence. The figure behind the desk opened another ledger and began making new entries, the precise handwriting filling page after page with plans, calculations, and arrangements that would ensure the natural order of things was properly maintained.

Outside, the city of Ankh-Morpork continued its nightly business, unaware that its cosmic schedule was being carefully managed by individuals who understood that some forms of mercy were too dangerous to be permitted.

### Chapter 10: The Domestic Consultation

Vimes arrived home to find the front door of Ramkin Manor standing open in a way that suggested either burglary or Lady Sybil's complete confidence in her ability to handle whatever might wander in. Given that this was Lady Sybil, and that she had once subdued an entire dragon with nothing but stern words and proper etiquette, Vimes suspected the latter.

The manor itself was a testament to what happened when old money met practical sensibility. The building had been in the Ramkin family for generations, accumulating both dignity and a certain comfortable shabbiness that suggested its owners were more concerned with substance than appearance. The hallway was lined with portraits of distinguished ancestors who had the sort of jaw-line that indicated centuries of telling other people what to do and expecting to be obeyed.

Vimes followed the sound of voices upstairs to the nursery, which Lady Sybil had transformed from the sort of sterile shrine to childhood that most aristocratic families favored into something that actually looked like children might live there. The walls were painted in cheerful colors, the floors were scattered with toys that showed evidence of actual use, and the overall atmosphere suggested that this was a place where learning happened through curiosity rather than discipline. He caught a glimpse of someone sweeping the hallway outside—one of the new cleaning staff, perhaps, though he moved with unusual economy of motion.

What was unusual was not Lady Sybil reading to Young Sam—that was as regular as sunrise and considerably more reliable than most of Ankh-Morpork's municipal services. What was unusual was that Death was sitting in the rocking chair next to her, apparently listening with rapt attention to "The Little Match Girl."

"Sam!" Lady Sybil looked up with the sort of calm pleasure that most people reserved for greeting expected dinner guests, rather than finding their husband standing in the doorway gaping at an anthropomorphic personification. "Your friend Death has been helping with story time. He has quite an interesting perspective on classic literature."

Lady Sybil's reaction to Death's presence was, Vimes reflected, entirely typical. She had been raised in the sort of household where one was taught to be polite to everyone, from visiting dignitaries to the occasional supernatural entity that might drop by for tea. Her education had included not only the usual accomplishments expected of a lady—languages, music, and the management of large households—but also a thorough grounding in what her governess had called "practical metaphysics."[^sybil] This was partly because the Ramkin family had always moved in circles where one might encounter anything from minor gods to major demons at dinner parties, and it was considered poor form to commit social gaffes due to ignorance about the nature of one's fellow guests.

Moreover, Lady Sybil had spent years breeding dragons, which had given her a practical understanding of the fact that the universe was considerably stranger and more interesting than most people imagined. Anyone who had successfully negotiated territorial disputes between highly intelligent reptiles was unlikely to be fazed by Death dropping by for a chat.

THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL IS A VERY POORLY STRUCTURED NARRATIVE, Death observed. THE ENDING IS UNNECESSARILY TRAGIC.

"Well, yes," Lady Sybil agreed. "Though I suppose it's meant to be a cautionary tale about social inequality."

Young Sam, who was three and had inherited his father's practical nature, looked up at Death with the sort of direct interest that only small children can manage.

"Are you really Death?" he asked.

YES.

"Do you have a horse?"

I HAVE BINKY. HE IS VERY RELIABLE.

"Can I ride him?"

I'M AFRAID THAT WOULD BE... PREMATURE.

"Oh." Young Sam considered this. "Do you want to hear about my toy soldiers?"

I WOULD FIND THAT EDUCATIONAL.

Vimes watched this exchange with the sort of bemused fascination usually reserved for watching natural disasters unfold in slow motion.

"Sybil," he said carefully, "why is Death in our nursery?"

"Well, dear, he was very interested in our child-rearing philosophies. Apparently, the literature on the subject is quite limited where he comes from." Lady Sybil turned a page. "And he's been very helpful. Did you know he's memorized most of the classic fairy tales?"

THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS ARE MUCH MORE ACCURATE, Death added. BEFORE THEY WERE... SANITIZED.

"Right," Vimes said. "Well, that's... educational."

Young Sam had begun arranging his toy soldiers in formation, explaining to Death the proper deployment of cavalry against infantry. Death listened with the sort of attention usually reserved for military briefings.

"He's quite good with children, actually," Lady Sybil observed. "Very patient. And he doesn't try to let Young Sam win at games, which is refreshing."

"You've been playing games?"

CHESS, Death said. HE IS QUITE SKILLED FOR SOMEONE WHO STILL COUNTS ON HIS FINGERS.

"I can count to twenty!" Young Sam announced proudly. "And Death taught me a new song!"

"A song?" Vimes asked, with the sort of parental dread that came from experience.

IT IS ABOUT SKELETONS, Death said defensively. IT IS EDUCATIONAL.

"Of course it is." Vimes settled into his chair, accepting that this was apparently his life now. "Well, don't let me interrupt story time."

Lady Sybil smiled and continued reading. Death occasionally interjected with historical corrections or alternative endings that were usually more optimistic than the originals. Young Sam fell asleep somewhere during "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," which Death had helpfully reinterpreted as a cautionary tale about breaking and entering and the importance of proper home security.

"Thank you for helping with bedtime," Lady Sybil whispered as they tiptoed out of the nursery.

I FOUND IT... ILLUMINATING, Death replied. CHILDREN HAVE A VERY DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH EXISTENCE.

"They do indeed. You're welcome to visit anytime, you know. Sam could use more friends who understand the importance of proper procedure."

Death nodded gravely and vanished, leaving behind the faint scent of eternity and the definite impression that Young Sam's bedtime stories would never be quite the same again.

"He's quite nice, really," Lady Sybil observed. "Though I do think his approach to fairy tales could use some work."

Vimes just nodded, making a mental note to have a word with Death about appropriate children's literature. Though, knowing Death, he had probably already considered the educational value of traditional stories versus their psychological impact on developing minds.

---

### Chapter 11: The Wedding Committee  

Vimes arrived at the Watch House to find the main office transformed into what appeared to be a strategic planning center for an operation of considerable complexity. This was notable because the Watch House's main office was normally the sort of place where strategic planning involved deciding whether to arrest someone today or wait until tomorrow when they might commit a crime that was actually worth the paperwork. A maintenance worker was sweeping near the entrance, moving with the sort of methodical precision that suggested either exceptional professional pride or possibly a deep philosophical approach to janitorial work.

But what caught Vimes's attention wasn't the usual chaos of wedding planning that had apparently overtaken his headquarters. It was the fact that Sergeant Colon, Nobby Nobbs, and Constable Cheery were huddled around Captain Carrot's desk like generals planning a campaign, surrounded by what appeared to be case files, crime scene photographs, and a detailed map marked with red pins.

"...and then there's the question of security," Cheery was saying, consulting a list that appeared to have been written in multiple hands, several different languages, and at least one script that might have been Dwarfish runes. "Because if someone's targeting people who should have died already, we need to think about who might be next."

Vimes paused in the doorway. "Cheery, please tell me you're not planning Carrot's wedding security based on a serial killer's victim selection criteria."

"Actually, Commander," Carrot said, looking up from what Vimes now realized was a comprehensive analysis of Death's "delayed transitions," "we've been cross-referencing the murder victims with the guest list. It's quite concerning."

"How concerning?"

"Well," Nobby said cheerfully, pointing to a chart covered in interconnected lines that resembled either a very complex family tree or a diagram of criminal conspiracy, "turns out that three of the people Death saved were supposed to be at weddings when they died. Margaret Dowdy was killed the day after her daughter's wedding, Thomas Keel was meant to die in a carriage accident on his way to his nephew's ceremony, and Marcus Cripley had been hired to investigate insurance fraud at wedding venues."

"Wedding venues?"

"Yeah, apparently there's been a lot of... accidents... at big society weddings lately," Colon explained, producing a file thick with incident reports. "Chandelier collapses, food poisoning, mysterious fires. Always during ceremonies that certain important people were attending."

Vimes studied the map, noting the pattern of red pins clustered around several of Ankh-Morpork's more fashionable churches and reception halls. "Someone's been targeting weddings?"

"Not exactly targeting," Cheery corrected. "More like... using them as opportunities. Big gatherings, lots of confusion, easy to slip in and out unnoticed."

"And Death's been preventing deaths at these events?"

INDEED, said Death, materializing beside the desk with the sort of timing that suggested he had been listening to the conversation from whatever cosmic vantage point anthropomorphic personifications used for surveillance purposes. I HAVE BEEN... PARTICULARLY ATTENTIVE... TO OCCASIONS OF JOY.

"Occasions of joy?"

WEDDINGS, BIRTHS, CELEBRATIONS. MOMENTS WHEN DEATH SEEMS... INAPPROPRIATE. Death gestured toward the crime scene photographs. I HAVE BEEN POSTPONING TRANSITIONS THAT WOULD INTERFERE WITH HAPPINESS.

"So our killer knows this, and is specifically targeting people whose deaths you've delayed because they were celebrating something?"

THAT APPEARS TO BE THE PATTERN, YES.

Carrot cleared his throat. "Which brings us to the security planning, Commander. If Death has been protecting people at weddings, and someone is systematically murdering those people..."

"Then my wedding might be a trap," Vimes finished. "A way to draw out either Death, or his protected targets, or both."

"Actually," Nobby said, consulting his notes, "we were thinking it might be a way to draw out the killer. You know, controlled circumstances, proper backup, all of us in fancy dress..."

"Nobby, you're not wearing a bridesmaid dress to catch a serial killer."

"But I've been practicing!"

Vimes studied the crime scene photographs spread across the desk—Sarah Palmley's squalid room, Thomas Keel's broken body, Margaret Dowdy's poison-twisted face. Each image told the same story: people who had died because someone decided their lives weren't worth preserving.

"You know what really pisses me off about this?" Vimes said, his voice carrying the sort of controlled fury that made experienced criminals suddenly remember urgent appointments elsewhere. "It's not just that someone's murdering innocent people. It's that they're murdering them for being inconvenient to a cosmic filing system."

He picked up Sarah's photograph, noting again the newspapers lining her baby's makeshift cot. "This woman died because Death decided a newborn deserved her mother. Because for once, the universe showed a bit of mercy. And someone decided that mercy was a mistake that needed correcting."

"Commander?" Carrot asked quietly.

"We're not just chasing a killer, Carrot. We're fighting a war against the idea that some lives matter less than others. That poor people, sick people, unlucky people should just die quietly and not trouble the cosmic accountants." Vimes's cigar had gone out, but he didn't seem to notice. "And you know what the really sick part is? The bastard we're looking for probably thinks they're doing the right thing. Maintaining order. Following proper procedure."

Death shifted uncomfortably. I HAVE CREATED... COMPLICATIONS.

"No, Death. You've discovered something called conscience. The complications were already there—you just started noticing them." Vimes turned to face his officers. "Right then. We're going to catch this murderer. But we're not doing it to restore cosmic balance or maintain universal order. We're doing it because Sarah Palmley's baby deserves to grow up in a world where mercy isn't considered a crime."

"And because," Nobby added cheerfully, "I look really good in blue."

"Nobby, you can't be a bridesmaid."

"Why not? I've got experience with formal dress. Remember the opera thing?"

"That was undercover work."

"This could be undercover work too. I could be investigating... wedding crime."

"Wedding crime?"

"You know, cake theft, flower vandalism, inappropriate plus-ones. Very serious stuff."

Vimes looked around the room at his assembled officers, all of whom were nodding as if this made perfect sense.

"Right," he said finally. "Well, as long as this doesn't interfere with actual police work, I suppose it's... harmless enough. But Nobby, you're not wearing a dress to Carrot's wedding."

"What about a nice frock?"

"No frocks either."

"A tasteful ensemble?"

"Nobby, you're going to wear your dress uniform, and you're going to like it."

Nobby looked crestfallen. "But I look really good in blue."

"Your dress uniform is blue."

"I meant blue with ruffles."

"No ruffles."

The committee returned to their planning, now discussing seating arrangements and whether it would be appropriate to have the wedding cake decorated with tiny handcuffs ("for luck"). Vimes retreated to his office, making a mental note to have a quiet word with Angua about what her boyfriend's colleagues were up to.

Outside his window, the city continued its eternal business of being complicated and morally ambiguous, but inside the Watch House, love was apparently being planned with military precision and an alarming amount of input from Nobby Nobbs.

It was, Vimes reflected, either the most romantic thing he'd ever witnessed, or the most elaborate practical joke in the history of law enforcement. Possibly both.

### Chapter 12: The Preservative Trail

The morning after Cheery's revelations about the mysterious preservative chemicals, Vimes found himself standing outside Moribund's, one of Ankh-Morpork's more specialized shops. The establishment occupied a narrow building wedged between a respectable bakery and a shop that claimed to sell "imported curiosities" but probably dealt in items that customs officials preferred not to examine too closely.

Moribund's catered to what the proprietor politely called "the preservation trade"—taxidermists, collectors of rare specimens, and the occasional individual whose hobby involved keeping things from decay in ways that most people preferred not to think about too deeply. The shop's front window displayed an impressive collection of stuffed animals, preserved flowers, and various bottles containing substances that moved with an oily consistency that suggested they had opinions about being disturbed.

The bell above the door chimed with a sound like distant church bells as Vimes entered, followed by Cheery, who carried a small vial containing the residue she'd found at the crime scenes. The interior of the shop had the sort of atmosphere that suggested time moved differently here—dust motes drifted lazily through shafts of colored light, and the air carried scents of chemicals, old leather, and something vaguely medicinal that might have been formaldehyde or possibly something considerably more exotic.

Behind the counter stood Mr. Moribund himself, a thin man with the sort of pale complexion that came from spending years in poorly ventilated rooms working with chemicals that most people handled only while wearing protective equipment. He had the precise, careful movements of someone who understood that his materials could be dangerous if mishandled, and his shop reflected this attention to detail—everything was labeled, organized, and stored according to principles that prioritized safety over convenience.

"Commander Vimes," Moribund said, looking up from a ledger where he'd been making entries in handwriting so small it might have been secret code. "How may I assist the Watch today? I trust this isn't about the incident with Mrs. Colon's cat again. I've told her repeatedly that preservation requires advance planning. You can't simply bring me an animal that's been deceased for a week and expect museum-quality results."

"Actually, Mr. Moribund, we're hoping you might help us identify a substance," Vimes said. He gestured to Cheery, who approached the counter with her vial.

"I found traces of this at several crime scenes," Cheery explained, setting the vial carefully on the counter. "It appears to be some sort of preservative, but it's unlike anything I've encountered in standard forensic work."

Moribund examined the vial with the sort of professional attention that suggested both genuine interest and considerable expertise. He held it up to the light, swirled the contents gently, and even opened it briefly to sample the scent with the careful technique of someone who had learned not to inhale unknown chemicals too enthusiastically.

"Interesting," he murmured, closing the vial and setting it down with careful precision. "This is quite specialized. Not the sort of thing one uses for preserving flowers or small animals."

"What sort of thing is it used for?"

"This particular formulation is designed for... larger specimens. Human-sized, one might say. And it's formulated to work very quickly—most preservation processes require days or weeks to be fully effective, but this would arrest decay almost immediately upon application."

Cheery made notes in her book. "Is it something you carry in stock?"

"Oh, no. Nothing like this. This is custom work—the sort of thing that requires special ordering and considerable expertise to prepare safely." Moribund paused thoughtfully. "Though I suspect I know where it might have come from."

"Where?"

"There's only one place in the city that deals in preservation chemicals of this quality and specialization. Morbius and Company, down in the Merchant Quarter. They supply materials to the university's medical school, the Guild of Embalmers, and... certain private collectors who require discretion in their activities."

Vimes felt the familiar tingle of recognition that came when an investigation began to focus on specific leads. "Private collectors?"

"There are individuals in Ankh-Morpork who have unusual hobbies, Commander. Some collect stamps, some collect coins, others collect... biological specimens. Morbius provides the materials necessary to maintain such collections in pristine condition."

"Would they keep records of their sales?"

"Oh, most certainly. The Guild of Alchemists requires detailed documentation for any materials that could be used in... irregular ways. Though I should mention that Morbius is very discreet about his client list. Professional confidentiality, you understand."

Vimes thanked Moribund and left the shop with Cheery, both of them now armed with a specific lead to follow. As they walked through the twisting streets toward the Merchant Quarter, Vimes reflected that every case seemed to lead eventually to someone with an unusual hobby and a flexible relationship with conventional morality.

"Commander," Cheery said as they navigated the crowds of mid-morning shoppers and merchants, "if someone is using professional-grade preservation chemicals, that suggests they have access to considerable resources."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning this isn't just someone who decided to start killing people. This is someone with connections, money, and knowledge of specialized materials. Someone who treats murder like a technical problem to be solved with the right equipment."

As they approached Morbius and Company—a respectable-looking establishment with a discreet sign and windows that had been designed to prevent casual observers from seeing too much of the interior—Vimes found himself hoping that their investigation wouldn't uncover anything too horrible. In his experience, people who collected biological specimens and had access to industrial-grade preservatives rarely confined their interests to anything as innocent as pressed flowers or butterflies.

"Right then, Cheery," he said, pausing outside the shop to light a cigar. "Let's see what sort of customer might need enough preservation chemicals to embalm a person quickly and efficiently."

"And let's hope," Cheery added quietly, "that they don't have a large collection already."

### Chapter 13: The Scent and the Scheme

Sergeant Angua was having the sort of morning that reminded her why enhanced senses could be both a blessing and a curse. She had spent the better part of an hour following a scent trail that led from Marcus Cripley's murder scene through half of Ankh-Morpork's more respectable neighborhoods, and what she had discovered was both illuminating and deeply troubling.

The trail told a story that her human colleagues couldn't have detected without supernatural assistance. The killer had a distinctive scent—not quite human, heavily contaminated with chemicals, and carrying undertones that suggested both extreme cleanliness and something organic that had been prevented from following its natural cycle of decay. It was the smell of someone who worked regularly with preservation processes, but also someone who had spent considerable time around... preserved things.

The trail had led her to three separate locations before finally terminating at a modest townhouse in Sator Square, a respectable address occupied by people who valued privacy and could afford to maintain it. The house itself was unremarkable—well-maintained but not ostentatious, with the sort of architecture that suggested its owner preferred not to attract attention. Clean windows, fresh paint, a small garden that showed evidence of careful maintenance but no particular creativity.

What made Angua's enhanced senses react with alarm was the scent emanating from the building. Death. Not recent death, but old death that had been... preserved. The chemical undertones she'd detected at the murder scenes were much stronger here, mixed with other scents that suggested the building housed a collection of biological specimens that had been maintained in conditions that most people would find deeply unsettling.

She was crouched behind a convenient shrub, making notes about the building's layout and the patterns of activity she could detect, when Captain Carrot appeared beside her with the sort of quiet efficiency that suggested he'd been practicing stealth techniques when no one was looking.

"Anything interesting?" he asked quietly.

"The killer lives here," Angua said without hesitation. "The scent trail leads directly to this building, and the smells coming from inside... Carrot, I think we've found someone who collects dead things."

"Dead things?"

"Preserved specimens. The whole place reeks of preservation chemicals and old death. Not decomposition—death that's been prevented from decomposing."

Carrot studied the building with the sort of methodical attention that had made him the Watch's most thorough investigator. "Any sign of current activity?"

"Someone's inside. Moving around on the upper floors. And there are scents suggesting they've been here recently—within the last few hours."

They settled in to observe the building, noting the patterns of activity within and the general layout of the surrounding area. The neighborhood was quiet, populated by people who maintained regular schedules and appeared to mind their own business with the sort of determination that suggested they'd learned not to ask too many questions about their neighbors' hobbies.

After an hour of observation, during which they had confirmed that the building was occupied by someone who kept irregular hours and rarely opened the windows, Carrot produced a folder containing the insurance fraud cases that Marcus Cripley had been investigating.

"I've been analyzing Cripley's files," he said, keeping his voice low. "The pattern is quite disturbing. Someone has been staging near-death experiences at social events—weddings, christenings, anniversary celebrations—then collecting life insurance payouts when the 'victims' died of 'unrelated' causes weeks or months later."

"Fake near-death experiences?"

"Not fake. Real. People who should have died but didn't, then died later when they were supposed to be safely recovered." Carrot turned a page, showing Angua a list of names, dates, and insurance companies. "The insurance companies were starting to notice the pattern—too many claims involving people who'd had dramatic recoveries followed by sudden relapses."

"So Cripley was investigating insurance fraud, but stumbled onto actual murder."

"Exactly. And look at this." Carrot pointed to a particular entry in Cripley's notes. "He identified a connection between all the suspicious deaths. Someone with access to medical information, insurance records, and detailed knowledge of the victims' schedules."

Angua studied the file, noting the meticulous documentation that had probably cost Cripley his life. "Someone who knew exactly when and how these people were supposed to die originally."

"And who had the resources to stage believable near-death experiences, then murder the victims later in ways that appeared to be natural causes or accidents."

"There's something else," Angua said, pointing to another entry. "Cripley noted that the insurance payments weren't going to normal accounts. The money was being transferred to something called 'Reality Management Services'—a company that seems to exist only on paper. No office, no employees, just a series of accounts that lead... nowhere."

"That's odd. Who would hire someone through a company that doesn't exist?"

"Someone who doesn't want to be traced. Or..." Angua paused, her nose twitching as she caught a faint scent. "Someone who might not be entirely human."

As they continued their surveillance, a figure emerged from the townhouse—average height, unremarkable appearance, wearing clothes that suggested middle-class respectability without drawing attention to themselves. The sort of person who could blend into crowds and be forgotten as soon as you looked away.

But what caught Angua's attention was the scent. This was definitely their killer, carrying the distinctive mixture of preservation chemicals and old death that she'd detected at all the crime scenes.

"That's him," she whispered to Carrot.

They followed at a discrete distance as the figure made its way through the city streets with the sort of purposeful movement that suggested someone on official business. The route led them through several neighborhoods, past various shops and civic buildings, before terminating at an office building in the financial district.

"Insurance offices," Carrot observed, noting the signs displayed in the building's lobby. "Our killer works in insurance."

"Which explains how they knew about the victims' policies, their medical histories, and their scheduled deaths," Angua said. "They've been using their access to cosmic scheduling information to commit insurance fraud on a cosmic scale."

As they watched the building, both officers reflected that they had uncovered something considerably more complex than a simple serial killer. This was someone who had found a way to profit from Death's mercy, turning compassion into a business opportunity and treating murder as a form of cosmic accounting.

"Commander Vimes needs to see this," Carrot said, photographing the building and making notes about their surveillance.

"Agreed. Though I suspect he's not going to be pleased about the bureaucratic implications."

As they prepared to return to the Watch House with their findings, Angua caught one more scent on the wind—something familiar, but not quite identifiable. Something that reminded her of... eternity.

Death was taking an interest in these proceedings.

She just hoped he was on their side.

### Chapter 14: Administrative Complications

The communication arrived with its usual precision—midnight exactly, delivered through channels that left no trace of origin or destination. The killer opened the encoded message with practiced efficiency, though the contents proved more... challenging... than usual.

*Subject surveillance protocols indicate elevated Watch attention. Multiple investigations proceeding simultaneously. Recommend operational review and possible procedural modifications. Maintain current assignments but prepare contingency measures.*

The killer made notes in the margin of their operational log. The Watch was becoming inconveniently thorough in their investigation. This was problematic but not unprecedented—law enforcement occasionally demonstrated unexpected competence, requiring adaptation of standard procedures.

More concerning was the message's tone. Their employers valued efficiency and discretion above all else. The fact that contingency measures were being discussed suggested that the operation was attracting the sort of attention that cosmic entities found... unwelcome.

The killer reviewed their case files methodically, looking for potential vulnerabilities in their operational security.

*Subject: S. Palmley - No complications. Standard cleanup protocols successful.*
*Subject: T. Keel - Minor witness concerns, resolved through secondary interventions.*
*Subject: M. Dowdy - No operational difficulties.*
*Subject: M. Cripley - Investigation target eliminated before complications could develop.*

Four successful corrections, each executed according to specifications. The work had been professional, efficient, and appropriately discrete. So why were their employers expressing concern about Watch attention?

The answer, upon reflection, was probably methodological. The killer had chosen varied techniques for each assignment—strangulation, blade work, poison, blunt trauma—to avoid creating obvious patterns. But perhaps the variety itself had become a pattern. Perhaps the Watch's investigative capabilities were more sophisticated than anticipated.

A second chime indicated another communication. The killer activated the device with mounting concern.

*Additional intelligence suggests Watch investigation has identified connection between subjects. Recommend immediate implementation of Protocol Seven: elimination of investigative personnel. Authorization granted for expanded operational parameters.*

The killer paused in their note-taking. Protocol Seven was... extensive. It involved targets beyond the original irregularities—anyone who posed a threat to operational security. The Watch personnel, their families, potentially their contacts and sources.

This represented a significant escalation from individual corrections to systematic elimination of an entire investigative apparatus. The work would be challenging, certainly, but more importantly, it suggested that their employers were becoming concerned about exposure.

The killer had worked for these entities for several years, handling various administrative corrections with consistent professionalism. The arrangement had been mutually beneficial—the killer received compensation and resources, while their employers maintained cosmic order according to their preferred parameters. But Protocol Seven suggested that the relationship was entering a more... complicated... phase.

The killer stood and moved to the specialized cabinet where more extensive equipment was stored. Protocol Seven would require items beyond the standard precision instruments—explosive devices, wide-area toxins, systems designed for multiple simultaneous eliminations rather than individual corrections.

As they made preparations, the killer reflected on the philosophical implications of their work. The original assignments had been clear: correct scheduling irregularities, restore proper order, maintain cosmic efficiency. These were noble goals, achieved through precise application of professional expertise.

But eliminating Watch personnel for investigating murders... that felt less like cosmic correction and more like simple crime prevention. The distinction was subtle but important. The killer preferred to think of their work as serving higher purposes rather than merely covering up evidence of previous activities.

Another communication arrived, this one marked with the sort of urgent designations that suggested immediate implementation was expected.

*Time parameters for Protocol Seven: 48 hours maximum. Begin with primary investigative personnel, expand to secondary contacts as necessary. Utilize maximum efficiency protocols. Discretion remains paramount but secondary to completion.*

Forty-eight hours to eliminate an entire police investigation. The killer began calculating resource requirements, timing considerations, and logistical challenges. It would require everything in their arsenal plus several items that would need to be acquired through specialized channels.

More troubling was the implication that their employers were willing to sacrifice discretion for speed. This suggested either desperation or external pressure that made the normal procedural considerations irrelevant.

The killer sealed the communication devices and began methodical preparation for what would either be the culmination of their professional career or its unfortunate termination. Protocol Seven had never been fully implemented before—the theoretical frameworks existed, but practical application remained untested.

Still, the work was what the work was. Their employers valued results over philosophical concerns, and the killer had built their reputation on delivering exactly what was requested, when it was requested, according to specifications.

They returned to their desk and began finalizing plans for the elimination of Commander Vimes, his immediate subordinates, and anyone else who posed a threat to the beautiful order that their employers sought to maintain.

It was, after all, just another job. Simply larger in scope than previous assignments.

The killer checked their pocket watch. Forty-seven hours and thirty-three minutes until Protocol Seven implementation was complete.

Time to begin.

### Chapter 15: The Explanation

Vimes was working late in his office, surrounded by case files and trying to piece together the connections between the murders and the wedding venues. The Watch House had settled into its usual nighttime quiet, and the gas lamps cast long shadows across the accumulated evidence of his investigation.

He was studying a map showing the locations of all the "accidents" at society weddings when Death appeared in the chair across from his desk. Not with fanfare or supernatural effects, but simply there, as if he had been part of the furniture and Vimes had only just noticed him.

"Death." Vimes didn't look up from his map. "I was wondering when you'd turn up. We've been making some progress on the murders, but there are still pieces missing."

I HAVE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE RELEVANT.

This time Vimes did look up. "What kind of information?"

Death was quiet for a long moment, as if deciding how much to reveal.

I HAVE BEEN... EXPERIENCING... CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES WITH MY DUTIES.

"What sort of difficulties?"

I HAVE BEEN FINDING IT... CHALLENGING... TO GUIDE PEOPLE'S TRANSITIONS AT MOMENTS OF GREAT JOY OR TRAGEDY. A WOMAN GIVING BIRTH. A MAN ON HIS WAY TO A WEDDING. SOMEONE CELEBRATING WITH FAMILY.

"You've been going soft."

Death considered this with the sort of careful attention. PERHAPS. IT SEEMS... UNNECESSARILY CRUEL... TO INTERRUPT SUCH MOMENTS.

"So you've been delaying transitions?"

OCCASIONALLY. BRIEFLY. LONG ENOUGH FOR THE CELEBRATION TO FINISH, OR THE BABY TO BE SAFELY BORN. I TELL MYSELF IT IS... ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY.

"But someone doesn't approve of your administrative efficiency."

PRECISELY. Death's voice carried what might have been frustration. THERE ARE... ENTITIES... WHO VALUE PROCEDURE ABOVE COMPASSION. THEY CONSIDER MY... FLEXIBILITY... TO BE PROBLEMATIC.

Vimes felt the pieces clicking into place. "So they've hired someone to clean up after your mercy. To kill the people you couldn't bring yourself to take when they were scheduled."

YES. SOMEONE WHO CONSIDERS KINDNESS TO BE A COSMIC ERROR REQUIRING CORRECTION.

"That's sick." Vimes lit a cigar, noting how the flame seemed steadier in Death's presence. "So our victims - Sarah Palmley, Thomas Keel, Margaret Dowdy, Marcus Cripley - they all lived past their appointed time because you decided to be decent."

I PREFER TO THINK OF IT AS... PROPER TIMING.

"And now someone's murdering them for your kindness."

Death considered this with the sort of attention usually reserved for cosmic equations. I HAD NOT CONSIDERED THE... EMOTIONAL IMPLICATIONS.

"It's a very practical approach to murder." Vimes stood up, reaching for his coat. "Right then. I think it's time we caught this killer before they murder anyone else for the crime of being shown mercy."

THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE YOU SHOULD KNOW.

"What?"

SOMEONE HAS BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT MY... POLICY CHANGES. SOMEONE WITH ACCESS TO COSMIC SCHEDULING INFORMATION.

"What kind of someone?"

THERE ARE... ENTITIES... WHO VALUE ORDER ABOVE ALL ELSE. THEY CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL COMPASSION TO BE... PROBLEMATIC.

Vimes felt the familiar prickle of recognition that came when a case shifted from merely complicated to genuinely dangerous. "Cosmic entities who don't approve of mercy?"

PRECISELY. THEY DO NOT COMMIT MURDER THEMSELVES. THEY SIMPLY... HIRE SOMEONE TO CORRECT IRREGULARITIES.

"A cosmic hit man."

THAT WOULD BE AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION.

As they prepared to leave the Watch House, Vimes reflected that his job had just gotten considerably more complicated. It was one thing to police a city where the criminals were merely human. It was quite another to investigate murders committed on behalf of beings who considered the entire universe to be insufficiently organized.

Still, he'd dealt with worse odds. Probably.

"Right then, Death. Let's go prevent a murder and catch a killer."

WHERE ARE WE GOING?

"To save Robert Tinsdale's life, and to get the evidence we need to solve this case properly."

As they left the Watch House, Vimes reflected that it was probably the first time in his career that he'd gone to solve a case with Death as his partner. It was either going to be very efficient, or it was going to create paperwork that would haunt him for the rest of his considerably extended life.

Either way, it was bound to be interesting.

### Chapter 16: The Briefing

The next morning, Vimes called an all-hands meeting in the Watch House's main office. The timing was strategic—early enough that everyone was present but late enough that the coffee had had time to work its municipal magic on the assembled officers. The room had been cleared of the wedding planning materials that had taken up permanent residence there, and in their place was the sort of organized chaos that suggested serious police work was about to happen.

The evidence board dominated one wall, covered with photographs, maps, timelines, and the red string that connected everything to everything else in ways that made perfect sense if you understood how police investigations actually worked. Captain Carrot had prepared a comprehensive summary of their findings, Cheery had organized her forensic evidence with military precision, and even Nobby had managed to contribute a surprisingly coherent report about the insurance fraud connections, though he kept adjusting his collar in a way that suggested he was still getting used to wearing normal clothes again.

Constable Reg Shoe sat in the back, taking notes with the methodical attention of someone who understood that paperwork was eternal, even if you weren't. As the Watch's only undead officer, he had been following the case with particular interest, especially since it seemed to involve fundamental questions about the nature of death and whether people had the right to remain alive past their scheduled expiration dates.

"Right then," Vimes said, surveying his assembled officers with the sort of grim satisfaction that came from finally having enough pieces of the puzzle to see the complete picture. "I've got some new information about our killer, and about why these particular people were targeted."

He lit a cigar, using the few seconds of ritual to organize his thoughts. What he was about to tell them was going to sound completely mad, but it was also the truth, and his officers deserved to know what they were really dealing with.

"Our victims—Sarah Palmley, Thomas Keel, Margaret Dowdy, Marcus Cripley—weren't killed because of who they were. They were killed because of when they didn't die."

"Commander?" Carrot asked, though his expression suggested he was following the logic even if the implications were disturbing.

"Each of these people should have died months ago. Sarah in childbirth, Thomas in his carriage accident, Margaret from consumption, Marcus from a dozen different close calls. But something intervened. Someone decided their deaths would be... inappropriate... at those particular moments."

Vimes took a drag on his cigar, noting how his officers were listening with the sort of focused attention that suggested they trusted his judgment even when his explanations ventured into territory that most people preferred to leave unexplored.

"Someone showed them mercy. Postponed their scheduled deaths because the timing was wrong—too sad, too cruel, too disruptive to moments of joy or hope."

"Scheduled deaths?" Angua asked quietly.

"Everyone has an appointed time. When that time comes, you die. It's efficient, it's orderly, it's been working for centuries. But recently, there have been... administrative irregularities. People who should have died were allowed to live a bit longer."

Colon raised his hand tentatively. "Commander, how do we know all this? I mean, who keeps track of when people are supposed to die?"

This was the question Vimes had been dreading. How do you explain that Death himself had told you about cosmic scheduling without sounding like you'd been spending too much time sampling evidence from drug busts?

"I have... sources... with access to information about these matters," he said carefully. "The important thing is that someone with considerable resources has decided these postponements represent errors that need correcting."

"Someone's killing people for not dying on schedule?" Cheery asked, though her expression suggested she was already working out the forensic implications.

"Now hang on just a minute," Reg Shoe interrupted, his voice carrying the sort of righteous indignation that came from someone who had personal experience with irregular death scheduling. "Are you telling me that people are being murdered for *not* dying when they were supposed to?"

"That's right, Reg."

"That's absolutely outrageous!" Reg stood up, waving his notebook. "I died when I was supposed to, and I'm still working! What's their excuse? If these cosmic entities have a problem with people not staying dead, they should take it up with the proper authorities, not hire assassins!"

"Exactly. They've hired a professional—someone with access to specialized preservation chemicals, detailed knowledge of their victims' backgrounds, and the sort of methodical approach that treats murder like administrative cleanup."

Nobby squinted at the evidence board. "So we're looking for someone who works in... cosmic scheduling?"

"More likely someone who works in insurance and has contacts with... higher authorities... who value order over individual circumstances." Vimes gestured toward the files that Carrot and Angua had compiled. "The insurance fraud angle fits—someone using their access to mortality data to profit from postponed deaths."

"Right," Carrot said, consulting his notes. "So we're dealing with someone who has connections to both the insurance industry and whatever... entities... manage cosmic scheduling."

"That's a very specific job description," Angua observed.

"Indeed it is. Which should make them easier to find." Vimes stubbed out his cigar. "The question is: do we arrest them for murder, insurance fraud, or cosmic interference in municipal affairs?"

"Can we charge someone with cosmic interference?" Colon asked hopefully.

"I'm sure Lord Vetinari will have opinions about jurisdiction," Vimes said. "But first we catch them. Angua, you said you've tracked the scent to a specific building?"

"Sator Square. Someone who definitely works with preservation chemicals and spends time around... preserved specimens."

"Right then. We're going to pay them a visit. But first, let's hear what our investigation has turned up." Vimes gestured to Carrot and Angua. "Captain, Sergeant—tell us what you've found."

Carrot stepped forward with his notebook. "We've identified our suspect's location and probable occupation. The scent trail Angua followed led to a townhouse in Sator Square—Number 15, to be precise. The building houses someone who works extensively with preservation chemicals."

"And the insurance connection?" Vimes prompted.

"Marcus Cripley's files were quite comprehensive. He'd identified a pattern of fraudulent claims involving people who'd had near-death experiences at social events, then died later when they should have been recovering. The insurance companies were getting suspicious about the statistical anomalies."

Angua consulted her own notes. "The scent trail also led to the offices of Mutual Assurance and Benevolent Protection—it's a mid-level insurance company in the financial district. Our suspect works there, probably in claims assessment or risk evaluation."

"Someone with access to both customer medical histories and mortality statistics," Carrot added. "They'd know exactly who was supposed to die when, and they'd be in a position to profit from... correcting the schedule."

"The preservation chemicals suggest they're also involved in specimen collection," Angua continued. "The building in Sator Square contains extensive collections of... biological materials. Preserved. The scents are quite disturbing."

Cheery held up her analysis. "The chemicals used on our victims are expensive and specialized. Someone's been ordering them in bulk from Morbius and Company—enough to preserve dozens of human-sized specimens."

Vimes felt the pieces clicking together. "So we have someone who works in insurance, has access to cosmic death schedules, collects preserved specimens as a hobby, and considers postponed deaths to be a business opportunity."

"There's one more thing," Carrot said quietly. "The insurance records show our suspect has been filing claims on their own policies. Life insurance, taken out on people they knew were scheduled to die. When those deaths were postponed, they killed the victims themselves and collected the payouts."

"They've been profiting from both ends," Angua realized. "Professional fees for 'correcting cosmic errors' and insurance payouts from their victims' deaths."

"Right then. We're going to pay them a visit. But remember—this isn't just a murderer we're dealing with. This is someone who considers mercy to be a cosmic error. They think compassion disrupts the natural order of things, and they've found a way to profit from restoring it."

"That's sick," Colon said with feeling.

"Yes, it is. Which is why we're going to stop them." Vimes looked around the room at his officers, noting the sort of determined expressions that suggested they understood exactly what they were fighting for. "Any questions about the case that don't involve asking me to reveal my sources?"

There was a moment of silence as everyone processed the information. Finally, Nobby raised his hand.

"Commander, when you say cosmic entities... do you mean like gods? Or more like really big filing clerks?"

"Both, Nobby. Definitely both."

As the meeting broke up, with officers dispersing to their various assignments, Vimes reflected that he had managed to brief his team on the essential facts without actually explaining how he'd learned them. His relationship with Death would remain private, but his officers now understood what they were really dealing with: someone who considered murder to be a form of cosmic accounting.

It was, he thought, enough truth to do the job without revealing anything that would require even more complicated explanations.

Some secrets were worth keeping, especially when they involved friendships that transcended the normal boundaries between life and whatever came after.

### Chapter 17: The Visit

Number 15 Sator Square was the sort of building that apologized for existing. Not ostentatiously shabby enough to attract the attention of municipal improvement societies, nor well-maintained enough to suggest its owner had money worth stealing, it occupied that perfect middle ground of architectural respectability that allowed its occupant to blend seamlessly into the urban landscape.

The building stood three stories tall, with the sort of narrow windows that suggested either a desire for privacy or a reluctance to pay window tax. The front door was painted a color that might once have been green but had faded to something that could charitably be called "municipal beige." A small brass nameplate beside the door read "A. Mortimer," which was either the most ironic name possible for someone in the death business or exactly the sort of name that cosmic entities with limited imagination might choose for their earthly representative.

Vimes stood across the square with Captain Carrot, Sergeant Angua, and Sergeant Detritus, studying the building with the sort of professional attention that suggested they were planning something considerably more complex than a social call. The morning light cast long shadows across the square, and the general atmosphere suggested that whatever happened next would probably require paperwork.

"Right then," Vimes said, checking his notebook. "A. Mortimer, claims assessor for Mutual Assurance and Benevolent Protection, probable collector of preserved specimens, suspected of killing people for not dying on schedule. Anyone have any better ideas about how to approach this than knocking on the door and asking politely about their hobbies?"

"We could wait for them to leave and search the premises," Carrot suggested, though his tone indicated he understood this wasn't really an option.

"We could surround the building," Angua added. "Though if they have a collection of preserved specimens, we might want to be prepared for... unpleasant discoveries."

"We could just arrest them," Detritus said, in the tone of someone who considered direct action to be the most efficient solution to most problems. "Dat much easier dan talking."

Vimes considered these options while studying the building. The windows were clean but curtained, the small front garden was maintained but not creative, and the overall impression was of someone who preferred not to attract attention to themselves or their activities.

"No," he said finally. "We're going to do this properly. Official visit, formal questioning, everything according to regulations. If A. Mortimer wants to explain why they've been murdering people for cosmic schedule violations, they'll have the opportunity to do so in an official capacity."

They crossed the square with the sort of measured pace that suggested serious official business was taking place. Carrot had prepared a comprehensive list of questions, Angua was tracking scents that told stories about the building's inhabitants, and Detritus carried his crossbow with the sort of casual confidence that suggested he was prepared for whatever they might encounter.

Vimes knocked on the door with the sort of authoritative rap that suggested the Watch was here on business and expected to be taken seriously.

The door opened to reveal a person whose most striking feature was how determinedly unremarkable they appeared—average height, bland features, wearing clothes that suggested middle-class respectability without drawing attention to themselves. But Vimes, with three decades of reading people, noticed the details: hands that were too clean, as if scrubbed with something stronger than soap. Eyes that moved constantly, cataloguing exits and potential weapons. The sort of stillness that came from someone who had learned to suppress every natural human gesture that might betray personality.

"Yes?" The voice was carefully modulated, neither friendly nor hostile, but there was something underneath—a faint accent that suggested education, breeding even. This wasn't someone who had fallen into murder. This was someone who had chosen it as a career path.

"A. Mortimer?" Vimes showed his badge, noting how Mortimer's gaze fixed on it with the intensity of someone calculating threat levels. "Commander Sam Vimes, Ankh-Morpork City Watch. We'd like to ask you some questions about your work with Mutual Assurance and Benevolent Protection."

"Ah." Mortimer's expression didn't change, but their hands moved slightly—not quite reaching for anything, but positioning themselves. Someone with combat training, Vimes realized. "I wondered when you'd arrive. I've been rather expecting this conversation. I suppose you'd better come in."

The interior of the house was exactly what Vimes had expected from someone who treated murder as a technical problem requiring specialized equipment. The front room was furnished with the sort of careful neutrality that suggested its occupant spent no more time here than necessary. Clean, organized, and entirely without personality.

"Please, sit down," Mortimer said, gesturing to chairs that looked like they had been selected more for functionality than comfort. "I assume this is about my recent claims assessments?"

"Among other things," Vimes said, settling into a chair that creaked ominously under his weight. "We're investigating a series of murders—people who died under circumstances that suggest professional expertise and access to specialized preservation chemicals."

"I see." Mortimer nodded as if this was a perfectly reasonable topic of conversation. "And you believe I might have information relevant to your investigation?"

"We believe you might have considerably more than information," Carrot said, consulting his notebook. "We've traced the preservation chemicals used at the crime scenes to purchases made by someone matching your description. We've also identified a pattern of insurance fraud involving people who survived near-death experiences."

"And," Angua added quietly, "the scents in this building suggest you've been working with preserved biological specimens. Recently."

Mortimer considered this information with the sort of calm attention that most people reserved for weather reports or tax assessments.

"I see you've been thorough," they said finally, and for the first time, something like genuine emotion crept into their voice—not fear, but a kind of professional appreciation. "How much do you know about cosmic scheduling irregularities?"

"Enough to know that some people consider mercy to be an error requiring correction," Vimes said. "Care to explain your perspective on the matter?"

Mortimer was quiet for a moment, then moved to a cabinet and poured themselves a glass of what appeared to be expensive brandy. They didn't offer any to their guests—a telling detail about someone who lived entirely for themselves.

"Commander, my family has served the cosmic order for seven generations. Insurance, actuarial science, statistical analysis—we've always been in the business of calculating risk and managing uncertainty." Mortimer took a sip. "When I was approached by the Auditors, it wasn't just a job offer. It was a calling. A chance to serve something greater than municipal concerns or individual sentiment."

"So you decided to restore that order?"

"I believed I was preventing chaos. Each postponed death creates ripple effects—economic disruption, emotional trauma for families who have to watch loved ones suffer, resources wasted on medical care that only delays the inevitable." Mortimer's voice carried the conviction of someone who had convinced themselves their work was noble. "The Auditors showed me the mathematics. Sarah Palmley's baby would have been better off in an orphanage than growing up in poverty. Thomas Keel's accident would have saved his family years of caring for someone with chronic injuries. I thought I was being merciful."

"You mean someone who could murder people and make it look like natural causes," Detritus said, his voice carrying the sort of blunt honesty that came from someone who had never seen any point in polite euphemisms.

"I prefer to think of it as quality control. The universe operates according to specific parameters. When those parameters are violated, adjustments must be made."

Vimes felt his old copper's instincts kicking in—the combination of anger and professional satisfaction that came from confronting someone who thought they could explain away murder with bureaucratic language.

"These entities," Vimes said carefully. "Got names, do they?"

Mortimer's composure flickered for the first time. "They call themselves... the Auditors of Reality. They ensure that existence follows proper procedures. Life, in their view, is acceptable only when it conforms to established patterns. Deviations must be... corrected."

"And they pay well for murder?"

"They don't see it as murder. To them, these people were already dead—their continued existence was simply a filing error that needed to be resolved. I was merely... implementing necessary corrections to the cosmic ledger."

"Right," Vimes said, his voice carrying a dangerous edge. "And what happens when they decide you're an irregularity that needs correcting?"

For the first time, genuine fear flickered across Mortimer's face. They set down the brandy glass with hands that weren't quite steady. "I... that hadn't occurred to me. But I'm not an irregularity. I'm their solution."

"Are you? Because from where I sit, you look like someone who's been skimming from the cosmic order. Fifty thousand dollars in fraudulent insurance claims, according to our investigation. I wonder what the Auditors think about employees who profit from their work?"

Mortimer's carefully maintained composure cracked entirely. "How did you... that was completely separate from the quality control program!"

"Was it? Sarah Palmley," Vimes continued relentlessly. "New mother. Strangled with her own shawl. But not before you collected on the life insurance policy you'd taken out on her six months ago, betting she wouldn't survive childbirth."

"She was scheduled to die in childbirth. Her survival created statistical anomalies that required correction."

"Thomas Keel. On his way to his nephew's wedding. How much did you collect when he survived that carriage accident?"

"The accident was meant to be fatal. His survival disrupted the cosmic schedule."

"Quality control," Vimes repeated, his voice carrying the sort of dangerous calm that suggested someone was about to have a very bad day. "Right then, A. Mortimer. You're under arrest for the murders of Sarah Palmley, Thomas Keel, Margaret Dowdy, and Marcus Cripley. And for cosmic conspiracy to commit murder on behalf of interdimensional bureaucrats."

Detritus stepped forward, looming over Mortimer with the sort of presence that suggested resistance would be both futile and inadvisable. "Dat means you come wit us now," he explained helpfully.

Mortimer looked up at the seven-foot troll and appeared to reach the conclusion that cooperation was the wisest course of action.

As Carrot produced the handcuffs and began reciting the formal charges, Vimes reflected that some cases were simpler than they initially appeared. Sometimes evil really was just bureaucracy taken to its logical conclusion—the reduction of human lives to data points in someone else's filing system.

And sometimes the best response to cosmic order was good old-fashioned justice, applied with whatever force necessary to remind the universe that some things were worth fighting for.

As they led Mortimer away, Vimes felt a chill that had nothing to do with the weather. Somewhere in the spaces between realities, entities that valued order above existence had just learned that their earthly operative had been compromised.

The real threat, he suspected, was just beginning.

### Chapter 18: The Cosmic Committee Meeting

In a space that existed between dimensions, where geometry was optional and time moved according to bureaucratic necessity rather than physical law, three entities convened for what they termed an "emergency consultation regarding operational irregularities."

The Auditors of Reality existed in perfect uniformity, their gray robes indistinguishable from the gray void that surrounded them. They had no faces because faces implied individuality, and individuality was an error in the cosmic filing system. When they spoke, their voices carried the authority of beings who had never experienced doubt, creativity, or the slightest deviation from universal regulations.

"IRREGULARITY REPORT," announced the first Auditor, producing what appeared to be a file folder that somehow managed to be even more gray than everything else in the space. "OPERATIVE DESIGNATION: A. MORTIMER. STATUS: COMPROMISED. PROBABILITY OF DISCLOSURE: ONE HUNDRED PERCENT."

"ASSESSMENT," demanded the second Auditor, though they already knew the answer with the sort of mathematical certainty that made actual conversation unnecessary. The Auditors conducted meetings not because they needed to exchange information, but because proper procedure required documentation of all decisions.

"THE OPERATIVE HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES. INTERROGATION IS INEVITABLE. COSMIC INVOLVEMENT WILL BE DISCLOSED. THIS REPRESENTS A CATASTROPHIC BREACH OF SECURITY PROTOCOLS."

The third Auditor consulted what might have been a ledger, though it contained entries that would have made accountants weep with their perfect, soul-crushing precision. "CASUALTIES TO DATE: FOUR TERMINATED IRREGULARITIES. MISSION COMPLETION: INSUFFICIENT. NUMEROUS ANOMALIES REMAIN UNCORRECTED."

"FURTHERMORE," continued the first Auditor, its voice carrying the sort of displeasure that cosmic entities expressed through statistical probability adjustments, "THE PRIMARY IRREGULARITY—DESIGNATION: VIMES, S.—CONTINUES TO EXIST DESPITE MULTIPLE TERMINATION OPPORTUNITIES. HIS SURVIVAL RATE EXCEEDS ACCEPTABLE PARAMETERS BY SEVEN THOUSAND PERCENT."

"THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE," declared the second Auditor. "ORDER REQUIRES PREDICTABILITY. WHEN SCHEDULED DEATHS ARE POSTPONED, IT CREATES CASCADING IRREGULARITIES THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM."

"AGREED. THE SITUATION REQUIRES DIRECT INTERVENTION."

There was a pause in the conversation, filled with the sort of cosmic silence that suggested even beings of infinite bureaucratic authority occasionally encountered situations that required... careful consideration.

"HOWEVER," added the third Auditor slowly, "DIRECT INTERVENTION CARRIES RISKS. THERE ARE... OTHER ENTITIES... WHO HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN MAINTAINING THE CURRENT IRREGULARITIES."

"SPECIFY."

"SHE HAS BEEN... OBSERVED... IN THE VICINITY OF THE PRIMARY IRREGULARITY. HER POWER TO INFLUENCE OUTCOMES MAKES HER A POTENTIAL OBSTACLE TO CORRECTIVE MEASURES."

"SHE WOULD NOT DARE INTERFERE WITH COSMIC REGULATION."

"SHE HAS INTERFERED BEFORE. HER ABILITY TO... MANIPULATE... PROBABILITY AND CIRCUMSTANCE HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED. SHE APPEARS TO TAKE PERSONAL INTEREST IN CERTAIN IRREGULARITIES."

The first Auditor processed this information with the sort of methodical attention that cosmic entities applied to problems that threatened the fundamental order of existence.

"ASSESSMENT: THE LADY REPRESENTS AN UNACCEPTABLE VARIABLE. HER TENDENCY TO... INTERVENE... AT CRUCIAL MOMENTS IS WELL-DOCUMENTED. IF WE PROCEED WITH DIRECT INTERVENTION, SHE MAY RESPOND WITH COUNTER-MEASURES THAT COULD DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK."

"HOWEVER," the second Auditor added, "FAILURE TO ACT WILL RESULT IN CONTINUED DEGRADATION OF COSMIC ORDER. THE IRREGULARITIES ARE SPREADING. OTHER ENTITIES ARE BEGINNING TO QUESTION ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES."

"DEATH HIMSELF HAS BEEN OBSERVED DEVELOPING... EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENTS. THIS REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL CORRUPTION OF COSMIC FUNCTION."

The third Auditor consulted its ledger again, turning pages that rustled with the sound of infinite bureaucratic precision.

"RECOMMENDATION: LIMITED DIRECT INTERVENTION. ELIMINATE THE PRIMARY IRREGULARITY THROUGH PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. IF THE LADY ATTEMPTS TO INTERFERE, ESCALATE TO FULL COSMIC AUTHORITY."

"AND IF FULL COSMIC AUTHORITY PROVES INSUFFICIENT?"

"THEN WE IMPLEMENT PROTOCOL SEVEN: UNIVERSAL RESET. RETURN ALL VARIABLES TO BASELINE PARAMETERS. ELIMINATE ALL IRREGULARITIES THROUGH COMPLETE SYSTEMIC REORGANIZATION."

The silence that followed this suggestion was the sort of quiet that preceded either cosmic enlightenment or universal catastrophe.

"PROTOCOL SEVEN HAS NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED," observed the first Auditor.

"PROTOCOL SEVEN WOULD ELIMINATE ALL LIFE, ALL DEATH, ALL CHANGE, ALL UNCERTAINTY," added the second.

"PROTOCOL SEVEN WOULD RESULT IN PERFECT ORDER," concluded the third. "COMPLETE PREDICTABILITY. ETERNAL SILENCE."

"IT WOULD BE... BEAUTIFUL."

They contemplated this possibility with the sort of reverent attention that other beings might reserve for religious experiences or really excellent spreadsheets.

"HOWEVER," the first Auditor continued reluctantly, "PROTOCOL SEVEN REQUIRES UNANIMOUS COSMIC CONSENT. THE LADY'S OPPOSITION WOULD PREVENT IMPLEMENTATION."

"THEN WE PROCEED WITH LIMITED INTERVENTION. AUTHORIZE PROFESSIONAL TERMINATION OF THE PRIMARY IRREGULARITY. MONITOR FOR EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE. PREPARE ESCALATION PROTOCOLS."

"AGREED."

"AGREED."

"MOTION APPROVED. IMPLEMENTING IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE MEASURES."

As the Auditors faded back into their gray void, the space between dimensions seemed to shiver slightly, as if reality itself was nervous about what had just been decided.

Somewhere in the city of Ankh-Morpork, a certain Commander of the City Watch was about to discover that his biggest problem wasn't municipal crime or cosmic irregularities.

His biggest problem was that he had become interesting enough for cosmic entities to hold committee meetings about him.

And cosmic entities, as a general rule, preferred their universes to be considerably less interesting.

### Chapter 19: The Unconventional Patrol

Vimes was doing his evening rounds through the more respectable parts of the city—the sort of neighborhood where the criminals wore better clothes and committed more expensive crimes, but were generally more polite about it. The transition from the Shades to Scoone Avenue was like stepping from one world into another, or possibly from one century into another, depending on one's perspective on urban development and social progress.

Scoone Avenue represented Ankh-Morpork's attempt at genteel respectability. The buildings were taller, cleaner, and showed evidence of recent maintenance. The streets were wider, the lighting was better, and the general atmosphere suggested that this was a place where people worried more about property values than immediate survival. It was the sort of neighborhood where crime was conducted with proper paperwork and a reasonable respect for social conventions.

The evening light cast long shadows between the well-maintained buildings, creating the sort of urban landscape that suggested civilization had made a serious effort and was quite pleased with the results. Gas lamps provided pools of warm light at regular intervals, and the overall effect was considerably more wholesome than anything the Shades had to offer. This was probably why Vimes always felt slightly uncomfortable here—too much wholesomeness made him suspicious.

He was contemplating the philosophical implications of municipal lighting policy when he spotted two figures on patrol near the intersection with Treacle Mine Road. One was clearly Sergeant Colon, instantly recognizable by his distinctive waddle and the way he held his truncheon like it might suddenly develop teeth and attempt to bite him. Colon's approach to law enforcement was based on the theory that most criminals could be discouraged through the application of reasonable conversation and the implied threat of paperwork.

The other figure appeared to be a woman in a blue dress and bonnet, walking with a gait that suggested either recent injury, unfamiliarity with feminine footwear, or possibly both. The dress was clearly expensive—silk, by the look of it—but it had been fitted to someone with dramatically different proportions than its current wearer. The overall effect was less "elegant lady" and more "person attempting to impersonate an elegant lady based on written descriptions."

Vimes approached with the sort of professional interest that came from years of recognizing trouble before it fully materialized.

"Evening, Sergeant," he called out.

Colon spun around with the guilty expression of a man caught doing something he couldn't quite explain.

"Oh! Commander! Lovely evening for a patrol, isn't it?"

"Indeed. And your... companion?"

The woman in blue turned around, revealing a face that was definitely familiar despite the application of what appeared to be Lady Sybil's rouge and powder.

"Evening, Mister Vimes!" Nobby said in a voice pitched approximately three octaves higher than usual. "Lovely night, isn't it? Perfect for... patrol activities."

Vimes stared. "Nobby, why are you wearing a dress?"

"Dress?" Nobby looked down at himself as if noticing his attire for the first time. "This old thing? It's not a dress, it's a... tactical urban camouflage ensemble."

"It's a dress, Nobby."

"Well, technically, yes. But it's for police work!"

"Police work."

"Yeah!" Nobby's enthusiasm was only slightly dampened by his attempt to maintain a feminine voice. "See, we've been having trouble with that pickpocket who's been working the market, right? The one who only targets lone women?"

"Go on."

"Well, Sergeant Colon here had the brilliant idea that we could catch him in the act. I volunteer to be the bait, being as I'm naturally... compelling."

Vimes looked at Nobby, who was indeed compelling, though not necessarily in the way they intended. The dress was blue silk, clearly expensive, and appeared to have been borrowed from someone with significantly different proportions. The bonnet was askew, the makeup was applied with more enthusiasm than skill, and Nobby's attempts at walking in heels were producing a gait that could charitably be described as "interpretive."

"Compelling," Vimes repeated.

"Oh yes," Colon interjected. "Very convincing. We've had three marriage proposals already."

"Marriage proposals?"

"Well, two marriage proposals and one business proposition," Nobby corrected. "I told them I was already spoken for. Maintaining character, you understand."

"Character."

"Yes! I'm Lady Nobitha of... er... Ankh. I'm new in town, looking for a nice little shop to buy. Very innocent, very vulnerable, perfect pickpocket bait."

Vimes studied Nobby's ensemble more carefully. "That's Lady Sybil's dress."

"She said I could borrow it!" Nobby said quickly. "For official police business! She was very understanding about the whole thing. Even gave me tips on walking in heels."

"Lady Sybil taught you to walk in heels."

"She's very supportive of innovative policing techniques. Also, she said the blue brings out my eyes."

Vimes closed his eyes and counted to ten. When he opened them, Nobby was still there, still in a dress, still looking quite pleased.

"And has this... innovative technique... produced any results?"

"Well," Colon said, "we did catch three pickpockets, two confidence tricksters, and a man selling fake jewelry."

"Really?"

"Yeah, but they weren't the ones we were looking for. Turns out there's a lot more crime in this area than we thought. Who knew women had to deal with this sort of thing all the time?"

"Educational experience, then."

"Very educational," Nobby agreed. "Did you know that walking in heels is basically a form of torture? And don't get me started on this corset thing. I don't know how women breathe in these things."

"You're wearing a corset?"

"Lady Sybil insisted. Said it was important for proper posture and authenticity. I think it's cutting off circulation to my brain."

"That would explain a lot," Vimes muttered.

Just then, a young man approached the group with the sort of confident swagger that usually preceded either a sales pitch or a marriage proposal. He was well-dressed in the manner of someone who wanted to appear more successful than he actually was, with rings on every finger and a gold tooth that glinted when he smiled.

"Excuse me, miss," he said to Nobby, sweeping off his hat with an elaborate flourish, "but I couldn't help noticing you from across the street. Such elegance! Such poise! Might I introduce myself? Reginald Threepwood, purveyor of fine exotic jewelry and precious stones from across the Circle Sea."

Nobby batted his eyelashes, which was a sight that would haunt Vimes's dreams for weeks.

"Oh my," Nobby simpered, clasping his hands together in what was presumably meant to be a feminine gesture of delight. "How very exciting! I'm Lady Nobitha of... er... Upper Ankh. I've only just arrived in the city and I'm positively overwhelmed by all the wonderful shops and... things."

"Ah, a lady of refinement!" Threepwood's eyes lit up with the predatory gleam of a man who thought he'd found easy prey. "Then you'll appreciate quality when you see it. Allow me to show you some pieces from my personal collection - jewels fit for royalty, madam, but priced for the discerning lady of moderate means."

He produced a velvet-lined case filled with what was obviously theatrical jewelry - the sort of gaudy paste gems that looked impressive in dim light but wouldn't fool a child in daylight.

"This particular necklace," he said, lifting a string of glass beads with all the reverence of a priest handling sacred relics, "was worn by the Empress of Klatch herself. Genuine rubies from the mines of Gebra, each one worth a king's ransom. Normally I wouldn't part with such a treasure for less than five hundred dollars, but for a lady of your obvious taste and breeding..."

"Five hundred dollars?" Nobby gasped, fanning himself with what appeared to be a lace handkerchief. "Oh dear, that does sound rather a lot. You see, I'm just a poor widow, trying to make my way in the world with only my dear departed husband's small inheritance."

Vimes had to admire Nobby's performance. The voice was pitch-perfect, the gestures were convincingly feminine, and the widow story was a nice touch that suggested both respectability and limited funds.

"A widow!" Threepwood's expression became appropriately sympathetic while his eyes calculated. "My dear lady, I had no idea. Please, allow me to offer you a special price - say, two hundred dollars? I know it's still a considerable sum, but this necklace would complement your natural beauty so perfectly..."

"Oh, but I don't know anything about jewelry," Nobby said helplessly. "How can I be sure it's genuine? I've heard there are unscrupulous people in the city who might try to take advantage of a simple woman like myself."

"Madam! I am shocked that you would even suggest such a thing!" Threepwood placed a hand over his heart with theatrical outrage. "These are my credentials!" He produced a scroll covered in official-looking seals. "Certified by the Guild of Jewelers and the Association of Precious Metals!"

Vimes squinted at the scroll from where he stood. Even from a distance, he could see it was a fishing license with some fancy borders drawn on in colored ink.

"Well," Nobby said, apparently studying the document with great care, "if you're sure it's genuine... But perhaps I should ask my friend here what he thinks?" He turned to gesture at Vimes. "This is my escort, Mister... er... Ironfoundersson. He's very wise about these matters."

Threepwood's face fell slightly as he took in Vimes's uniform and general air of authority.

"Ah. Your... escort. I see." His smile became somewhat more strained. "Well, I'm sure any friend of yours would recognize quality when they see it."

"Actually," Vimes said, stepping forward with his best intimidating copper expression, "I think I recognize you, Mr. Threepwood. Didn't we have a conversation last month about selling genuine Agatean silk that turned out to be painted potato sacking? And before that, wasn't there something about you trying to join a pirate crew with a vegetable-based sword fighting technique?"

Threepwood went pale. "I... that is... there must be some mistake... And it was a root vegetable! Very cutting edge sword work, that was!"

"Right then," Vimes said to Colon, "arrest him for attempting to defraud Lady Nobitha here. And check his credentials - I suspect that fishing license isn't quite what he claims it is."

"My pleasure, Commander," Colon said, producing his handcuffs with evident satisfaction.

As Colon moved in for the arrest, Nobby turned to Vimes with a triumphant grin.

"See? Effective policing through innovative disguise techniques!"

"Nobby, you're never wearing that dress again."

"What about for special occasions?"

"No special occasions."

"Undercover work?"

"No undercover work."

"What if Carrot needs a bridesmaid?"

Vimes started walking away. Behind him, he could hear Nobby explaining to the arrested jewelry seller that they were actually a policeman, which seemed to confuse the man more than the arrest itself.

"But you're wearing a dress!" the man protested.

"I'm a very modern policeman," Nobby replied cheerfully.

Vimes reflected that the Watch had come a long way from the days when their biggest challenge was staying sober long enough to collect their wages. He wasn't entirely sure it was progress, but it was certainly never boring.

### Chapter 20: The Revelation

The case had developed into something considerably more complex than a simple serial killing. Death appeared at random intervals with the casual unpredictability of a natural phenomenon, manifesting during meals, on patrol, while Vimes was wrestling with reports that seemed to reproduce when he wasn't looking, and once memorably while he was having what could charitably be called a "progress meeting" with the Patrician about the murder investigation.

That particular encounter had taken place in Lord Vetinari's office, a room that had been designed to make visitors feel simultaneously impressed and slightly nauseous.[^oblong] The office occupied a space that was larger than it should have been, given the external dimensions of the building, and was decorated in what could only be described as "Aggressive Minimalism"—a style that suggested its occupant was too important to require actual furniture, but wealthy enough to afford very expensive empty space.

"Commander," Vetinari had said without looking up from a document that appeared to involve sulfur importation calculations, "I trust your investigation into the recent... irregularities... is proceeding satisfactorily? I've had some interesting correspondence about the matter from certain elevated sources."

"We've identified the pattern, my lord. Someone is systematically killing people who've survived near-death experiences - people whose deaths have been... postponed... for compassionate reasons."

"Ah, yes. The scheduling irregularities." Vetinari had set down his document with careful precision. "I've been receiving complaints about those from entities who value procedural correctness above individual circumstances. They seem quite concerned about unauthorized mercy interfering with proper cosmic administration."

During this discussion—which had rapidly evolved from case briefing through diplomatic complexity to what military strategists would recognize as interdimensional bureaucratic warfare—Death had simply materialized in one of the chairs and sat listening with the sort of professional interest that undertakers might show at a particularly well-organized funeral. He had occasionally nodded as if taking mental notes, though whether these concerned municipal finance, murder investigation techniques, or the philosophical implications of cosmic complaint procedures was unclear.

The Patrician, to his considerable credit, had barely raised an eyebrow at this development. He had simply continued his explanation of why the Watch's budget requests were simultaneously too large, too small, insufficiently detailed, and unnecessarily specific, while occasionally glancing at Death with the sort of mild acknowledgment he might show a colleague who had dropped by to observe an interesting meeting. But then, Lord Vetinari was the sort of man who would have managed to negotiate with the apocalypse, probably getting it to reschedule for a more convenient time and possibly extracting some concessions about the terms and conditions of universal destruction.

That particular meeting had been... educational. Vimes had noticed someone sweeping the corridor outside Vetinari's office during their discussion—unusual, since the Patrician's building was normally maintained to standards that made most monasteries look sloppy. The cleaner had worked with the sort of unhurried efficiency that suggested either exceptional dedication to municipal tidiness or possibly a very philosophical approach to maintenance work.

"Commander Vimes," Lord Vetinari had said, barely glancing up from his copy of the Ankh-Morpork Times, "I trust you are well? You look rather... accompanied today."

"I'm fine, my lord. Death is just... observing."

"Ah. How civic-minded." Vetinari had finally looked up, his gaze taking in Death with the same mild interest he might show a new type of filing cabinet. "Good morning, Death. I trust you are finding our municipal processes... illuminating?"

I AM LEARNING A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY.

"Excellent. One can never have too much education in the proper functioning of civic institutions." Vetinari turned a page with deliberate precision. "I was just reading this fascinating article about portable clacks towers. Apparently, some enterprising individual—a Mr. Moist von Lipwig, I believe you know him, Commander—is developing a system for installing them on carts. Mobile communication, as it were."

Vimes had glanced at Death, who was listening with what appeared to be professional interest. "That's... interesting, my lord."

"Indeed. The implications are quite staggering when one considers them fully." Vetinari steepled his fingers, a gesture that usually preceded what Vimes privately called a 'lecture disguised as a conversation.' "Imagine, if you will, the ability to coordinate across vast distances in real-time. Military applications are obvious, of course, but the commercial possibilities..." He paused, letting the thought hang in the air like incense.

"Commercial possibilities, my lord?"

"Oh, Commander. Consider a merchant who could communicate instantly with his warehouses, his ships, his... associates. No more delays, no more uncertainty about cargo arrivals. Supply and demand could be balanced with mathematical precision." Vetinari's smile was the sort that made hardened criminals confess to things they hadn't even thought of doing yet.

Death leaned forward with what appeared to be genuine interest. IT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY... EFFICIENT SYSTEM.

"Precisely, Death. Efficiency is the cornerstone of civilization. Though I can't help but wonder about the implications for law enforcement." His eyes had taken on that particular gleam that meant he was thinking several moves ahead of everyone else. "Imagine criminals coordinating their activities across the city in real-time. Or worse..." he paused for effect, "imagine if they could communicate while in moving vehicles. Drive-by clackings, as it were."

"Drive-by what now?" Vimes asked, though he suspected he already knew where this was going.

"Oh, nothing immediate to concern yourself with, Commander. Though it does raise interesting questions about the future of crime prevention. How does one patrol a crime that moves at the speed of light?" Vetinari appeared to consider this philosophical problem with genuine relish.

Death nodded thoughtfully. THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS QUITE FAST.

"Indeed it is, Death. Though not, I suspect, faster than a well-prepared mind." Vetinari smiled. "Which brings us to the question of preparedness. Commander, you might want to consider the budgetary implications of equipping your officers with mobile clacks units. For defensive purposes, naturally."

"My lord, we can barely afford stationary clacks units. The Patrician's Palace has better communication than the entire Watch combined."

"Yes, well. Perhaps we could discuss innovative funding solutions." Vetinari pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and began writing with the sort of deliberate care usually reserved for signing death warrants. "I'm sure the various Guilds would be interested in contributing to civic communication infrastructure. For a modest licensing fee, of course."

Death watched this process with fascination. YOU APPEAR TO BE SOLVING MULTIPLE PROBLEMS SIMULTANEOUSLY.

"One tries to be efficient, Death. For instance, the Thieves' Guild would naturally want to ensure that their... activities... remain properly regulated in an age of instant communication. A small contribution to Watch communication upgrades would demonstrate their civic spirit."

"You're going to tax them for the privilege of being policed better," Vimes realized.

"Tax is such an ugly word, Commander. I prefer to think of it as... subscription fees for municipal services. The Assassins' Guild, for example, would surely appreciate having better-equipped Watch officers. It makes their work more... challenging."

"They'd pay for the privilege of being hunted more effectively?"

"Commander, you underestimate the professional pride of our city's Guilds. Excellence recognizes excellence. They would see improved Watch capabilities as a mark of respect for their own skills."

Death appeared to be taking mental notes. THIS IS A VERY SOPHISTICATED APPROACH TO RESOURCE ALLOCATION.

"Thank you, Death. One finds that the key to successful governance is understanding that every problem is simply an opportunity viewed from the wrong angle." Vetinari finished writing and handed the paper to Vimes. "Here's a preliminary budget proposal. You'll notice I've included provisions for training, equipment maintenance, and a small contingency fund for... unexpected developments."

Vimes looked at the figures and blinked. "My lord, this budget is larger than our current annual allocation."

"Yes, well. One must plan for growth. Besides, I've already had preliminary discussions with several Guild representatives. They seem quite enthusiastic about the proposal."

"You discussed this before the technology even existed?"

"Commander, successful administration requires one to anticipate needs before they become urgent. By the time mobile clacks become commonplace, we'll already have the infrastructure in place to manage them properly." Vetinari leaned back in his chair with the satisfied air of a man who had just solved several problems that hadn't happened yet.

Death appeared genuinely impressed. YOU HAVE TURNED A POTENTIAL PROBLEM INTO A FUNDING OPPORTUNITY, A TRAINING EXERCISE, AND A DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVE.

"Precisely, Death. Efficiency requires seeing the connections between seemingly unrelated elements. Crime, technology, Guild politics, municipal budgets—they're all part of the same system. Change one element, and you must adjust all the others accordingly."

"Is there anything you haven't thought of, my lord?" Vimes asked, though he wasn't entirely sure he wanted to know the answer.

"Well, Commander, I have been wondering about the potential applications of this technology for... other purposes." Vetinari's smile became thoughtful. "Imagine, for instance, the ability to conduct government business remotely. Cabinet meetings via clacks. Remote voting on municipal ordinances. Virtual court proceedings..."

"Virtual what?"

"Oh, nothing immediate, Commander. Just... future considerations. Though I should mention that I've asked Mr. Lipwig to include certain... security features... in his mobile clacks design. For public safety, naturally."

The conversation had continued in this vein for some time, with Death occasionally asking penetrating questions about governance theory and resource management. Vimes had left the meeting with a headache, a new budget proposal that somehow made financial sense despite being mathematically impossible, three new policy initiatives he didn't remember agreeing to, and the distinct impression that Death was learning far too much about the administrative complexities of modern policing.

Also, he was fairly certain that Vetinari had somehow managed to get Death to agree to serve as a consultant on municipal efficiency studies, though he couldn't quite remember how that had happened.

But then, the Patrician was the sort of man who would have managed to negotiate with the apocalypse.

### Chapter 21: The Scheduling Irregularity

The assassination attempt happened on a Tuesday, which was either cosmically ironic or simply the sort of thing that happened when you were Sam Vimes and the universe had developed opinions about your continued existence.

It had been three days since they'd arrested A. Mortimer for the murders. Three days since Vimes had learned that cosmic entities called the Auditors of Reality were hiring people to murder those shown mercy. Three days for those same entities to realize their earthly operative had been compromised.

Vimes had been walking home from the Watch House through the relatively safe streets of the Temple Quarter, where the worst crimes were usually disputes over theological interpretation and the occasional aggressive charity collection. The evening was peaceful, the gas lamps cast their usual pools of warm light, and the general atmosphere suggested that even Ankh-Morpork's criminal element had decided to take the evening off. A temple maintenance worker was sweeping the steps of one of the smaller shrines, working through the evening shadows with patient thoroughness.

Which should have been his first warning that something was wrong.

The crossbow bolt missed him by inches, embedding itself in a lamp post with the sort of solid thunk that suggested serious professional equipment and considerable expertise in its use. Vimes's copper instincts, honed by decades of surviving in a city where violence was considered a form of aggressive municipal planning, had him moving before his conscious mind registered the danger.

He rolled behind a convenient statue of some long-dead civic leader who had probably never expected to provide cover during an assassination attempt, drew his sword, and began the sort of tactical assessment that separated experienced officers from optimistic amateurs.

One crossbow, fired from the shadows across the street. Professional quality, expensive quarrels, positioned for a clean shot with multiple escape routes. The sort of setup that suggested Guild training and considerable advance planning.

"Right then," Vimes called out to the darkness. "Professional courtesy time. I assume you're from the Guild of Assassins, and I assume you know I'm on the Do Not Kill list. So what's this about?"

A figure stepped from the shadows with the sort of fluid grace that came from years of specialized training in the graceful elimination of targets. They wore the black clothing favored by people whose profession required them to be invisible, and they carried themselves with the confidence that suggested considerable expertise in matters involving other people's mortality.

"Commander Vimes," the assassin said, their voice carrying the sort of educated accent that suggested expensive schooling and probably a degree in Classical Assassination with a minor in Practical Ethics. "I'm afraid there's been a... scheduling irregularity."

"A what now?"

"According to our records, you should have died several years ago. Multiple times, actually. Poison, falling masonry, knife work, an exploding carriage, that incident with the dragon, the thing with the vampires, and most notably when you were... displaced in time."

Vimes felt a chill that had nothing to do with the evening air. "When I was Keel."

"Yes. Our information suggests you should have died during the Glorious Revolution. Instead, you somehow... returned. The cosmic implications have been... significant."

"The Guild has received complaints. You're creating statistical anomalies in the mortality tables. Some of our clients are... concerned... about the disruption to natural order."

"Natural order?"

"Death, Commander. It serves a purpose. When people who are scheduled to die continue not dying, it affects the cosmic balance. There are entities who find this... problematic."

The pieces clicked together in Vimes's mind with the sort of clarity that came from years of police work and recent conversations with anthropomorphic personifications. "Someone's hired you to kill me because I keep not dying when I'm supposed to."

"That's a simplified but essentially accurate assessment."

"And you took the contract despite the Do Not Kill list?"

The assassin shifted slightly, and Vimes caught something that might have been embarrassment in their posture. "The Guild has been... pressured... by certain elevated clients. Entities who consider adherence to scheduling more important than professional courtesy."

"Cosmic entities."

"I'm not at liberty to discuss the nature of our clientele. But yes."

It was at this point that Death materialized beside them, but not with his usual dramatic timing. He appeared... confused. Uncertain. The sort of expression that belonged to someone who had arrived to collect something and found it wasn't there.

GOOD EVENING, Death said, though his voice carried a note of puzzlement.

"Death," the assassin replied, their voice carrying the sort of professional recognition that one expert might show another. "I wasn't expecting... your presence. Is this one yours?"

Death studied Vimes with the intensity of someone examining a complex equation that wasn't adding up correctly.

I... CAME TO GUIDE COMMANDER VIMES'S TRANSITION. HIS HOUR HAS STRUCK. BUT...

"But?" Vimes asked, though he wasn't entirely sure he wanted to know the answer.

BUT I CANNOT. THERE IS... SOMETHING... PREVENTING THE TRANSITION.

The assassin looked between Death and Vimes with the expression of someone whose professional understanding of the universe had just been significantly complicated.

"You can't guide his transition?"

NO. HIS LIFE TIMER CONTINUES TO RUN, BUT SOMETHING IS... INTERFERING... WITH THE NATURAL PROCESS.

"What sort of something?" Vimes asked.

THAT, Death said grimly, IS WHAT I INTEND TO DISCOVER.

Death reached into his robe and produced Vimes's hourglass. Instead of the usual sand, it was filled with what appeared to be cigar smoke, but the smoke was moving in patterns that defied several fundamental laws of physics. It swirled with purpose, forming shapes that looked almost like... protection.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS, Death admitted. SOMETHING IS ACTIVELY PRESERVING YOUR EXISTENCE AGAINST THE NATURAL ORDER.

"Natural order seems to be having a lot of problems lately," Vimes observed.

The assassin cleared their throat politely. "If Death himself cannot guide the target's transition, then the contract is... beyond our professional scope."

INDEED, Death agreed. THIS MATTER REQUIRES... INVESTIGATION.

"Investigation into what?"

INTO WHO OR WHAT HAS THE POWER TO PREVENT DEATH ITSELF. Death's voice carried the sort of concern that suggested this was not a routine occurrence. COMMANDER, YOUR CONTINUED EXISTENCE IS APPARENTLY BEING MAINTAINED BY FORCES THAT OPERATE OUTSIDE NORMAL COSMIC AUTHORITY.

The assassin bowed politely to both of them. "The Guild will be suspending all contracts related to Commander Vimes pending... resolution of these unusual circumstances. This appears to be a matter for cosmic authorities rather than professional services."

They faded back into the shadows just as heavy footsteps announced the arrival of Sergeant Detritus, who rounded the corner with his crossbow in hand and a grim expression that suggested he was prepared to ask questions after shooting things.

"Commander!" Detritus called out, then stopped and looked around at the peaceful street scene with evident confusion. "Carrot said dere was trouble. Where is trouble?"

"Just missed it, Sergeant," Vimes said, noting the relief in Death's skeletal features. "Professional consultation, you might say."

"Hmph." Detritus looked disappointed. "Dey always run away when I get here. Very inconsiderate."

Death nodded with what might have been approval. SERGEANT DETRITUS. YOUR TIMING IS... FORTUITOUS.

"Oh, hello Death," Detritus said with the sort of casual acknowledgment one professional might offer another. "You here on business?"

NOT... EXACTLY. THERE APPEAR TO BE... COMPLICATIONS.

This left Vimes with Death and his most reliable backup officer, both of whom seemed to understand that something significant had just happened, even if the details remained unclear.

"So," Vimes said, lighting a cigar with hands that were steadier than he felt. "Someone or something is keeping me alive, and you don't know who?"

CORRECT. AND THAT, COMMANDER, IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING.

"Because?"

BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY FEW ENTITIES WITH THE POWER TO OVERRIDE DEATH. AND MOST OF THEM HAVE... QUESTIONABLE MOTIVATIONS.

As they walked through the peaceful streets toward Ramkin Manor, Vimes reflected that some mysteries were more unsettling than others. Being protected by Death was one thing. Being protected by something powerful enough to override Death was quite another.

Behind them, the crossbow bolt remained embedded in the lamp post like a question mark punctuating the growing mystery of Sam Vimes's impossible survival.

Some irregularities, it seemed, had irregularities of their own.

### Chapter 22: The Data Trail

Two days later, Nobby and Colon returned to the Watch House with the sort of expressions that suggested they had discovered something either very important or very disturbing. Possibly both. Death was studying Cheery's forensic equipment with the sort of professional interest that suggested he was either learning new investigative techniques or contemplating career diversification.

"Commander," Colon said, setting down a stack of official documents with the careful reverence usually reserved for evidence in capital crimes. "You're going to want to see this."

THESE DOCUMENTS SMELL OF BUREAUCRACY, Death observed, leaning closer to examine the paperwork. AND SOMETHING ELSE. SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTS THEY WERE CREATED BY ENTITIES THAT DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE.

The documents were copies of various official records—birth certificates, death certificates, hospital admissions forms, insurance claims, and accident reports. They had been organized with the sort of methodical attention to detail that suggested either excellent police work or an unhealthy obsession with bureaucratic procedure.

"What am I looking at?" Vimes asked.

"Requests for information," Nobby said, consulting his notebook with uncharacteristic seriousness. "Someone's been systematically requesting copies of records related to people who've had near-death experiences."

"Someone official?"

"That's the thing, Commander. The requests all come from something called the 'Quality Assurance Department' of the 'Universal Life Management Corporation.' Very official-looking paperwork, proper stamps, all the right forms."

Colon produced a sample request form. "They've been filing these for months. Always asking for the same information—people who survived accidents, difficult births, serious illnesses, anything that should have been fatal but wasn't."

"And the record keepers just handed over the information?"

"Proper paperwork, Commander. You know how it is—if the forms are filled out correctly, nobody asks questions."

Vimes studied the request form with growing unease. It was professionally prepared, complete with official-looking seals and the sort of elaborate formatting that suggested considerable bureaucratic expertise. But something about it made his policeman's instincts itch.

"Has anyone heard of the Universal Life Management Corporation?"

"That's what we thought you'd ask," Nobby said proudly. "So we checked with the Guild of Merchants and Traders, the Tax Assessment Office, and the Commercial Registry."

"And?"

"There's no such company registered in Ankh-Morpork. Or anywhere else, according to the trade records."

At that moment, Captain Carrot and Sergeant Angua returned from their hospital canvassing, both of them carrying the sort of expressions that suggested their investigation had been educational in ways they hadn't entirely expected.

"Commander," Carrot said, "we need to talk. We've found something disturbing."

"More disturbing than a fictional company collecting information about near-death experiences?"

"Potentially, yes. The hospitals have been visited by representatives from the same Quality Assurance Department. They've been conducting what they call 'efficiency assessments' of patient survival rates."

"Efficiency assessments?"

"They wanted to know why certain patients survived when medical projections suggested they shouldn't have," Angua explained. "The hospital staff thought they were from some sort of medical research organization."

"Did anyone get a good look at these representatives?"

"That's the strange part," Carrot continued. "Everyone remembers them being very professional, very thorough, but nobody can give a detailed description. It's like they were... generically official."

Cheery looked up from her chemical analysis equipment. "That fits with what I've discovered about those preservation compounds. They're not just supernatural—they're specifically designed to prevent things from being remembered clearly. Memory preservation, if you will."

"Memory preservation?"

"Chemicals that ensure witnesses remember seeing someone official and professional, but can't recall specific details. It's very sophisticated work."

Vimes lit a cigar and studied the evidence they'd assembled. A fictional company collecting information about near-death experiences. Generic officials conducting efficiency assessments at hospitals. A professional killer using supernatural preservation compounds to eliminate people who had survived things they weren't supposed to survive.

"Right then," he said finally. "This isn't just murder. This is someone conducting a systematic campaign to eliminate people who've disrupted... what? Some sort of cosmic schedule?"

"It does suggest a rather... elevated... level of organization," Carrot agreed.

"The question is: who has the authority to decide that certain people aren't supposed to be alive? And why do they care enough to hire professional killers to correct the situation?"

Angua's nose twitched. "Commander, there's something else. The scent trail I've been following? It doesn't just lead to boarding houses and hotels. It also leads to several government buildings, including the Post Office and the Tax Assessment Department."

"Our killer's been visiting government offices?"

"Regularly. As if they were... filing reports. Or receiving assignments."

The pieces of the puzzle were starting to form a picture that Vimes didn't like at all. Someone with access to official channels, supernatural resources, and professional killers was systematically eliminating people for the crime of not dying when they were supposed to.

"I think," he said grimly, "we need to have a conversation with some people who understand cosmic scheduling. And I suspect I know who to ask."

### Chapter 23: The Municipal Response

The next morning brought an unusual sight: Commander Vimes walking purposefully toward the Patrician's Palace with a folder of evidence, Death walking beside him with the sort of skeletal dignity that suggested he found municipal politics interesting, and the sort of grim expression that suggested he was about to make someone's day considerably more complicated.

Lord Vetinari received them in the Oblong Office with the sort of calm attention that suggested he had been expecting this visit and had already prepared several responses to whatever Vimes was about to tell him. He barely glanced at Death, as if anthropomorphic personifications visiting his office were routine administrative matters.

"Commander. Death," Vetinari said with the sort of polite acknowledgment usually reserved for interdimensional diplomacy. "I trust your investigation has been... illuminating?"

"More than I'd like," Vimes replied, settling into the chair across from Vetinari's desk. "We're dealing with a systematic campaign to murder people who've survived near-death experiences. Professional killer, supernatural resources, and what appears to be cosmic authorization."

"Cosmic authorization?"

Vimes laid out the evidence—the fake company records, the efficiency assessments, the memory-preserving chemicals, the systematic data collection. "Someone with access to supernatural resources and official channels is treating human survival as a quality control problem."

Vetinari finally looked up from his document. "And you believe this represents a threat to municipal stability?"

"I believe this represents someone treating Ankh-Morpork citizens like statistical errors that need to be corrected. Which makes it my problem."

"Indeed." Vetinari stood and moved to his window, looking out over the city with the expression of someone who found the view both instructive and concerning. "The question, Commander, is whether this is a problem that can be solved through conventional law enforcement."

"What do you mean?"

"If, as your evidence suggests, we are dealing with entities that operate according to cosmic rather than municipal authority, then simply arresting them may prove... insufficient."

Vimes felt a familiar chill. "You know who's behind this."

"I have... suspicions. Based on previous encounters with entities that value order above existence, efficiency above compassion, and statistical purity above human life."

"The Auditors of Reality?"

Vetinari turned back to his desk and produced a file that Vimes hadn't seen him retrieve. "The Auditors have a long history of... interventions... when they perceive irregularities in cosmic order. Usually they work through intermediaries to avoid direct involvement in messy, unpredictable activities like murder."

"So they hire professional killers."

"They engage quality control specialists to address statistical anomalies. The terminology is important to them—they prefer to think of themselves as maintaining cosmic balance rather than committing murder."

Vimes studied the file Vetinari had produced. It contained reports of similar incidents in other cities, other times. Always the same pattern—people who had survived improbable circumstances, professional killers with access to supernatural resources, and official-looking paperwork that justified the murders as necessary corrections.

"This has happened before?"

"Regularly. Though usually in smaller communities where the local authorities lack the resources to investigate properly. Ankh-Morpork appears to be their first attempt at... large-scale quality control."

"And you've known about this?"

"I've been... monitoring... the situation. The Auditors tend to operate according to predictable patterns. They identify irregularities, authorize corrections, and then move on to other statistical problems. Usually the process takes several months to complete."

Vimes felt his anger rising. "You've been monitoring them while they murder people?"

"I've been gathering evidence, Commander. Evidence that could be used to challenge their authority under cosmic law. The Auditors may represent perfect order, but perfect order must follow its own rules."

"What rules?"

Vetinari opened the file to a page covered with the sort of dense, bureaucratic language that suggested considerable legal expertise. "Cosmic entities operating within municipal boundaries are subject to local jurisdiction in matters involving the welfare of citizens. It's an obscure provision, but it's legally binding."

"You mean I can arrest them?"

"You can certainly try. Though I suspect the attempt would be more... educational... than successful. However, there may be another approach."

Vetinari closed the file and looked directly at Vimes. "The Auditors operate according to bureaucratic principles. They value procedure, documentation, and proper authority. If we can demonstrate that their quality control program is itself creating irregularities..."

"We can force them to stop?"

"We can present them with a bureaucratic problem that requires their attention. And bureaucratic problems, Commander, have a way of consuming enormous amounts of time and resources."

Vimes grinned grimly. "You want to bury them in paperwork."

"I want to demonstrate that their solution is worse than the problem they're trying to solve. Which, based on your evidence, appears to be the case."

---

### Chapter 24: The Case Against Order

That afternoon, the entire Watch worked with the sort of focused intensity usually reserved for preventing riots or apprehending particularly dangerous criminals. But instead of chasing suspects through the city's more creative neighborhoods, they were building what Vimes had described as "the most important arrest case in the history of law enforcement."

The main office had been transformed into something that looked like a cross between a military command center and a very aggressive accounting firm. Maps covered every available wall surface, marked with pins indicating murder locations, data collection points, and official visits. Tables groaned under the weight of documents, witness statements, and forensic evidence. The air was thick with cigar smoke and the sort of determined concentration that suggested everyone understood the stakes.

"Right then," Vimes said, addressing his assembled officers. "We're going to prove that the Auditors' quality control program is causing more problems than it solves. Which means we need to document every irregularity their murders have created."

Cheery had prepared a detailed analysis that cut straight to the heart of the matter. "The preservation compounds contain something that shouldn't exist—temporal stabilizers mixed with essence of insurance fraud. Our killer isn't just committing murder, they're profiting from it through an elaborate scheme involving cosmic scheduling and actuarial manipulation."

"How so?" Carrot asked.

"They've been taking out life insurance policies on people they knew were scheduled to die, then collecting when Death postponed those deaths, then murdering the victims and collecting again. Double compensation for cosmic irregularities."

"So they're profiting from cosmic compassion?"

"Exactly. And the Auditors have been paying them additional fees for 'quality control services.' It's cosmic fraud on an interdimensional scale."

Sergeant Angua consulted her tracking notes. "The scent analysis confirms that our killer has been active for months, possibly years. But the chemical signature has been getting stronger recently, which suggests either escalation or desperation."

"Escalation?"

"They're using more powerful preservation compounds for each murder. Either the irregularities are getting harder to eliminate, or the Auditors are getting impatient with the pace of corrections."

Nobby had prepared what he proudly called "a comprehensive analysis of bureaucratic irregularities and insurance fraud," which connected the cosmic murders to a very earthly motive.

"The fake company paperwork isn't just about hiding murders," he reported. "It's about money. Lots of money. Our killer has been filing insurance claims through seventeen different companies, collecting death benefits on people they knew would survive their scheduled deaths, then killing them and collecting survivor benefits too."

"How much money are we talking about?"

"Over fifty thousand dollars so far. And that's just what I can trace. The Universal Life Management Corporation was a front for the biggest insurance fraud scheme in the city's history."

Sergeant Colon had cross-referenced the murder victims with city records and discovered something disturbing. "Commander, the people who were killed weren't just random survivors. They were all... productive members of society. Sarah was a skilled seamstress, Thomas was a reliable carriage driver, Margaret did charity work, Marcus was solving insurance fraud cases."

"So?"

"So their deaths have created secondary problems. Sarah's baby needs care, Thomas's regular passengers have lost reliable transportation, Margaret's charity work has stopped, Marcus's cases have gone unsolved. The Auditors haven't just killed four people—they've disrupted dozens of lives."

Captain Carrot had prepared the most comprehensive analysis, combining all their findings into what he called "a formal assessment of cosmic quality control effectiveness."

"The data shows that the Auditors' correction program has generated significantly more irregularities than it has eliminated," he reported. "Each murder has created ripple effects that have disrupted established patterns of social and economic activity."

"Give me specifics."

"Sarah's death left her baby orphaned, requiring intervention by municipal child welfare services. Thomas's death created transportation disruptions that affected seventeen regular customers and three local businesses. Margaret's death stopped charitable activities that were providing assistance to forty-three impoverished families. Marcus's death left twelve active fraud cases unresolved, representing potential losses of over eight thousand dollars."

"And the cosmic scarring Cheery mentioned?"

"Is accumulating faster than natural processes can repair it. At current rates, we're looking at significant reality distortion within six months."

Vimes studied the compiled evidence with growing satisfaction. It was the sort of comprehensive case that would make even cosmic entities think twice about their methodology.

"So," he said finally, "the Auditors' quality control program is causing more chaos than the irregularities they're trying to correct?"

"Significantly more," Carrot confirmed. "Their solution is demonstrably worse than the problem."

"Right then. Time to file some complaints."

---

### Chapter 25: The Direct Approach

The next morning, Vimes did something that few people in the history of the Disc had ever attempted: he filed a formal complaint against cosmic entities.

"Right then," he said, setting down his pen in the Watch House with the sort of finality that suggested he had just completed a task that would either solve everything or make everything considerably worse. "That should get their attention."

The document spread across his desk was three pages of official City Watch letterhead, complete with seals, signatures, and the sort of aggressive bureaucratic language that Vimes had learned from watching Lord Vetinari handle interdimensional diplomacy. The complaint was addressed to "The Auditors of Reality, or whoever is currently responsible for cosmic order and the unauthorized murder of Ankh-Morpork citizens."

Captain Carrot read over his shoulder. "Commander, are you sure about this approach?"

"Carrot, they sent an assassin after me because I'm an irregularity in their filing system. They hired a killer to murder innocent people for surviving near-death experiences. They treat human lives like accounting errors." Vimes lit a cigar with more force than was strictly necessary. "I'm not hiding from cosmic bureaucrats. If they want to discuss my continued existence, they can make an appointment like everyone else."

"But what if they actually respond?"

"Then we'll find out what they want, and we'll negotiate. Same as we do with the Guilds when they get ideas above their station."

"The Guilds are human, Commander."

"The Auditors are bureaucrats. Trust me, Carrot - the species doesn't matter. All bureaucrats think the same way: they want everything to be neat, predictable, and properly documented. The trick is making your position seem more bureaucratically sound than theirs."

As if summoned by the mention of bureaucratic procedure, the temperature in the room dropped several degrees. The gas lamps flickered, and the air took on the sort of oppressive quality that suggested cosmic entities with strong opinions about paperwork were materializing nearby.

Three figures appeared in the center of the office - gray, featureless, and radiating the sort of absolute authority that came from beings who had never been told they were wrong about anything. They wore robes that were less clothing than the absence of color, and they stood in perfectly geometric formation as if someone had arranged them with a mathematical compass.

"COMMANDER VIMES," said the first Auditor, its voice carrying the sort of precision that suggested each word had been checked against seventeen different dictionaries. "YOU HAVE SUBMITTED A FORMAL COMPLAINT REGARDING COSMIC ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES."

"That's right," Vimes said, standing up but not backing down. Years of dealing with Lord Vetinari had taught him that showing weakness to cosmic authority figures was a mistake you only made once. "Murder of Ankh-Morpork citizens is a crime under municipal law. I don't care who authorized it."

"THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE SCHEDULED FOR TERMINATION. THEIR CONTINUED EXISTENCE REPRESENTED VIOLATIONS OF COSMIC ORDER."

"So you hired someone to kill them."

"WE IMPLEMENTED NECESSARY CORRECTIONS TO MAINTAIN UNIVERSAL STABILITY."

Vimes took a long drag on his cigar, noting how the smoke seemed to swirl in patterns that defied the usual laws of air circulation. "Right. Well, under municipal law, that's called conspiracy to commit murder. You're under arrest."

The silence that followed this statement was the sort of quiet that preceded either cosmic enlightenment or universal catastrophe.

"YOU CANNOT ARREST COSMIC ENTITIES," said the second Auditor, though its voice carried a note of what might have been uncertainty.

"Watch me." Vimes gestured to Carrot, who produced handcuffs with the sort of professional efficiency that suggested he had been expecting this moment. "You have the right to remain silent, though I suspect you're not capable of remaining anything else. You have the right to representation, though I'm not sure what lawyer would take a case involving the fundamental nature of reality."

"THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED," declared the third Auditor.

"So is hiring assassins to kill people for surviving disasters. Unprecedented doesn't mean illegal." Vimes studied the three entities with the sort of professional attention he usually reserved for examining evidence. "The question is: are you going to come quietly, or do I need to call in the special circumstances team?"

"SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES TEAM?"

"Sergeant Angua handles supernatural suspects. Constable Igor is very good with entities that don't follow normal physical laws. And Captain Carrot here has experience with beings who think they're above municipal authority."

The Auditors consulted among themselves in the sort of rapid, whispered conference that cosmic entities used when their universal certainty encountered local law enforcement.

"WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORITY OF MUNICIPAL LAW ENFORCEMENT."

"And I don't recognize the authority of cosmic filing clerks to murder my citizens. Seems like we have a jurisdictional dispute." Vimes moved closer, noting how the Auditors seemed to recoil slightly from his presence. "Here's the thing about jurisdiction - it belongs to whoever's willing to enforce it. And I'm willing to enforce municipal law against anyone who breaks it, up to and including anthropomorphic personifications of universal order."

"YOU ARE ONE INDIVIDUAL. WE REPRESENT COSMIC AUTHORITY."

"I represent the people of Ankh-Morpork. And the people of Ankh-Morpork don't like it when cosmic entities murder their neighbors for the crime of not dying on schedule."

Carrot stepped forward with his handcuffs. "You have the right to a trial by jury of your peers, though finding cosmic entities willing to serve on a jury might be challenging."

"STOP," said the first Auditor, and the word carried enough authority to make the gas lamps flicker. "THIS... DISCUSSION... IS BECOMING IRREGULAR."

"Too right it's irregular. Murder usually is." Vimes crossed his arms. "So what's it going to be? Are you going to stop hiring killers to murder people for surviving near-death experiences, or are we going to have a very interesting conversation about extradition treaties between Ankh-Morpork and wherever it is you file your paperwork?"

The Auditors huddled together in what might have been panic, if cosmic entities were capable of emotions that disorderly.

"WE... REQUIRE... CONSULTATION," admitted the second Auditor reluctantly.

"With who?"

"ENTITIES OF HIGHER AUTHORITY. THIS SITUATION HAS... ESCALATED... BEYOND NORMAL PARAMETERS."

"Right then. You've got twenty-four hours to produce either a higher authority willing to negotiate, or evidence that you've stopped hiring assassins. After that, I'm issuing warrants for cosmic conspiracy, and we'll let the courts sort out jurisdiction."

"YOU CANNOT—"

"I just did." Vimes sat back down at his desk and picked up his pen. "Captain Carrot, please escort these entities off the premises. And remind them that interfering with a police investigation is also illegal under municipal law."

The door to the office opened and Sergeant Detritus entered, taking in the scene with the sort of professional assessment that came from years of backup work. He looked at the three gray figures, at Vimes behind his desk, and at Carrot standing ready with handcuffs.

"Dese are de entities dat been causing trouble?" Detritus asked, studying the Auditors with interest. "Dey not very impressive. I thought cosmic beings would be bigger."

"WHAT IS THAT?" asked the first Auditor, apparently noticing Detritus for the first time.

"Sergeant Detritus, City Watch," Detritus replied helpfully. "I specialize in difficult arrests and entities dat think dey are too important for municipal law."

"A TROLL?" The second Auditor seemed genuinely surprised.

"Very observant," Vimes said dryly. "Now, as I was saying—"

"WAIT," said the third Auditor. "TROLLS ARE... MATHEMATICAL. THEY UNDERSTAND PROPER ORDER."

Detritus considered this statement. "Dat true. I understand order very well. Dat why I know when someone is being disorderly." He gestured at the Auditors. "You been hiring killers to murder people. Dat very disorderly."

"WE WERE RESTORING COSMIC BALANCE."

"By committing crimes," Detritus said with the sort of blunt logic that made cosmic philosophy suddenly seem very simple. "Dat not balance. Dat just crime with fancy excuses."

The door opened again and Constable Reg Shoe entered, still carrying his notebook and looking slightly out of breath despite technically not needing to breathe.

"Sorry I'm late, Commander. I was filing the incident reports from—" He stopped and stared at the three gray figures. "Oh. Are these the entities that have been causing all the trouble?"

"WHAT IS THIS?" demanded the first Auditor, apparently even more disturbed by Reg's presence than they had been by Detritus.

"Constable Reg Shoe, Ankh-Morpork City Watch," Reg replied with professional courtesy. "I understand you've been hiring people to kill citizens who didn't die when you thought they should?"

"THAT ENTITY IS ALREADY DEAD," said the second Auditor, its voice carrying a note of cosmic confusion.

"Yes, well spotted," Reg said cheerfully. "I died several years ago on the barricades during the revolution. Very noble cause. But the thing is, I'm still here, still doing my job, still serving the public. Funny how that works, isn't it?"

"THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. THE DEAD SHOULD REMAIN DEAD."

"Says who?" Reg consulted his notebook. "I've checked the regulations, and there's nothing in municipal law that says being dead disqualifies you from public service. In fact, I'd argue that my continued existence proves that your whole cosmic scheduling system is rather inflexible."

"WE ARE THE AUDITORS OF REALITY. WE DEFINE WHAT IS POSSIBLE."

"Well, you're doing a terrible job of it," Reg said with the sort of professional criticism that civil servants reserved for poorly managed departments. "If dead people can keep working, and living people can survive past their scheduled termination dates, then maybe your system needs updating rather than enforcement through murder."

As the Auditors faded back into whatever dimension they came from—apparently having discovered that cosmic authority was somewhat less impressive when confronted by a troll with a clear understanding of right and wrong and a zombie with strong opinions about administrative competence—Carrot turned to Vimes with the sort of expression that suggested either admiration or concern for his commander's mental health.

"Commander, do you think that was wise?"

"Probably not. But it was necessary." Vimes returned to his paperwork. "Sometimes the only way to deal with bullies is to stand up to them. Even cosmic bullies."

"And if they come back with something worse than assassins?"

Vimes smiled grimly. "Then we'll find out just how far municipal authority extends into cosmic jurisdiction. Should be educational."

As Carrot and Detritus headed out to file their reports, Reg lingered behind, still studying his notes with the sort of professional interest that suggested he was working out the implications of what they'd just witnessed.

"Commander," he said thoughtfully, "can I ask you something? About all this cosmic scheduling business?"

"Go ahead, Reg."

"Well, it's just that I've been thinking about what those Auditors said. About people staying dead when they're supposed to." Reg consulted his notebook. "The thing is, I died when I was supposed to. Very definitely dead. Properly scheduled and everything. But here I am."

At that moment, Death materialized in the chair across from Vimes's desk, appearing with the sort of casual precision that suggested he had been listening to the conversation and had decided it required his input.

"Death," Vimes acknowledged. "Perfect timing."

INDEED. Death studied Reg with interest. CONSTABLE SHOE. I HAVE BEEN MEANING TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

"Oh. Er. Hello, Death," Reg said, suddenly looking uncertain. "I hope there isn't a problem with my... status?"

QUITE THE OPPOSITE. I FIND YOUR CONTINUED EXISTENCE... ILLUMINATING.

"Do you?" Reg perked up. "Because I've been wondering about the mechanics myself. I mean, I went through the whole dying process—very thorough, you were—but then I just... came back."

Death turned to Vimes. COMMANDER, YOU ASKED EARLIER ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SITUATION AND THAT OF CONSTABLE SHOE.

"I was wondering about that," Vimes said, lighting a cigar. "You can't guide my transition because of some cosmic irregularity involving friendship and tobacco smoke. But Reg here died properly and just... refused to stay transitioned."

PRECISELY. THE DIFFERENCES ARE... SIGNIFICANT. Death gestured to both of them. YOU, COMMANDER, APPEAR TO BE PROTECTED BY EXTERNAL FORCES—MY OWN RELUCTANCE TO COMPLETE THE TRANSITION, PERHAPS COMBINED WITH OTHER INFLUENCES WE DO NOT YET UNDERSTAND.

"And me?" Reg asked, leaning forward with interest.

CONSTABLE SHOE... Death paused, studying Reg with the sort of attention usually reserved for particularly complex cosmic equations. YOU SIMPLY REFUSED TO ACCEPT DEATH AS FINAL.

"Refused?"

WHEN I GUIDED YOUR TRANSITION, YOU WENT THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS. YOU EXPERIENCED DEATH FULLY—THE CESSATION OF BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION, THE SEPARATION OF SOUL FROM BODY, THE TRANSITION TO... WHATEVER COMES NEXT. BUT THEN...

"Then what?"

THEN YOU LOOKED AROUND, DECIDED THE AFTERLIFE WASN'T FOR YOU, AND CAME BACK. Death's tone carried what might have been admiration. I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT.

"Really?" Reg seemed pleased. "I just remember thinking that I had work to finish. People depending on me. Rights to defend."

MOST PEOPLE, WHEN THEY DIE, ACCEPT IT. THEY MOVE ON TO WHATEVER AWAITS THEM. YOU... SIMPLY REFUSED TO GO.

"Refused?" Reg looked puzzled. "Well, yes, I suppose that's accurate. I remember you arriving, very professional service, and I just... didn't go with you."

YOU WALKED AWAY.

"I had work to finish! People depending on me. I wasn't ready to stop being useful." Reg consulted his notebook. "I suppose I was rather rude about it, wasn't I? Just told you I'd catch up later and went back to my civic duties."

Death turned to Vimes. I GUIDED HIS TRANSITION. PROPERLY. ACCORDING TO SCHEDULE. BUT HE... REMAINED.

"So you don't actually... process zombies?" Vimes asked.

NO. THEY APPEAR TO... BYPASS... THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. Death's voice carried a note of professional confusion. I GUIDE THEIR TRANSITIONS, BUT THEY DO NOT... STAY TRANSITIONED.

"Oh, we don't go through any official channels," Reg said cheerfully. "We just refuse to accept death as final. Very simple, really. Bit of personal determination, strong sense of duty, and Bob's your uncle - still working despite being technically deceased."

"Also," Reg added thoughtfully, "I'm not the only one, you know."

"The only what?" Vimes asked.

"Zombie. There's Mrs. Cake's neighbor - comes back every few months when his pension's due. Fellow who runs the night shift at the post office - very dedicated to postal service. Lady who tends the memorial garden in Small Gods Cemetery - says someone needs to keep it proper."

Death went very still. THERE ARE... OTHERS?

"Oh yes. Quite a few, actually. We don't really organize or anything - bit hard to schedule meetings when some of us only turn up seasonally - but word gets around." Reg consulted his notebook. "Last I counted, there were at least two dozen of us just in the city. But that's only the ones I know personally."

"How many do you think there are... everywhere?" Vimes asked, though he suspected he wasn't going to like the answer.

"Well, if you extrapolate across the entire Disc..." Reg did some quick calculations. "Hundreds, certainly. Possibly thousands. I mean, every city has people with unfinished business. Every village has someone who just can't let go of their responsibilities."

AND THEY ALL... REFUSE TO STAY TRANSITIONED?

"Pretty much. We all get our transitions guided properly - you do excellent work, very thorough - but then we just... come back. No paperwork required."

Death was quiet for a very long moment. HUNDREDS... POSSIBLY THOUSANDS... OF PEOPLE WHO BYPASS DEATH ENTIRELY.

"Well, we don't bypass it exactly," Reg corrected. "We experience it fully. It's just that we don't consider it... binding."

Vimes whistled low. "So there are thousands of people who've discovered they can just... ignore cosmic authority through sheer bloody-mindedness."

I... Death paused, apparently trying to process this information. I HAD NO IDEA SO MANY PEOPLE COULD SIMPLY... REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH THE COSMIC ORDER.

"Oh, it's not about refusing to cooperate," Reg said earnestly. "We're very cooperative. We die when we're supposed to, we go through the proper process, we just happen to have continuing obligations that require our attention."

THE AUDITORS... Death's voice carried something approaching panic. THEY MUST BE... HORRIFIED.

"Why? We're not breaking any rules. There's nothing in the cosmic regulations that says you can't come back if you have important work to finish."

THERE... ISN'T?

"Not that I've found. I've checked quite thoroughly. Death is mandatory, but staying dead appears to be... optional."

I... Death paused, apparently trying to process this information. I WAS SIMPLY... PROCESSING PAPERWORK... AS SUBMITTED.

"Very thoroughly, too," Reg said approvingly. "Always got a response within a reasonable timeframe. Much more efficient than most government departments."

Death sighed. I WAS AFRAID YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.

"So," Vimes said slowly, "you're telling me that I can't die because cosmic forces are keeping me alive, while Reg can't stay dead because he's too stubborn to accept it?"

THAT IS... ESSENTIALLY ACCURATE.

"And this doesn't strike you as a problem with the cosmic system?"

COMMANDER, Death said wearily, I AM BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT THE COSMIC SYSTEM HAS A GREAT MANY PROBLEMS. RIGID SCHEDULING APPEARS TO BE ONLY ONE OF THEM.

Reg raised his hand. "If I may, Death, I think the real issue is flexibility. The Auditors want everything to follow exact schedules, but life—and death—are more complicated than that."

HOW SO?

"Well, look at it this way. I died on the barricades fighting for the people. That was important to me. More important than staying dead, as it turned out. The Commander here does important work protecting the city. Work that apparently transcends normal mortality schedules."

CONTINUE.

"Maybe the problem isn't that people aren't dying when they're supposed to. Maybe the problem is that the schedule isn't accounting for what people actually need to accomplish." Reg consulted his notebook. "Has anyone ever asked Death what he thinks about the cosmic schedule?"

"Good point," Vimes said. "Death, do you think the schedule is... accurate?"

Death was quiet for a long moment. I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE SCHEDULE FOR MILLENNIA. BUT RECENTLY... His voice trailed off.

"Recently what?"

RECENTLY I HAVE BEGUN TO NOTICE THAT SOME DEATHS SEEM... PREMATURE. UNNECESSARY. CRUEL.

"Like Sarah Palmley," Vimes said quietly.

YES. A YOUNG MOTHER, JUST AFTER GIVING BIRTH. THE TIMING SEEMED... INAPPROPRIATE.

"So you delayed it."

YES. AND THOMAS KEEL, ON HIS WAY TO A FAMILY CELEBRATION. AND MARGARET DOWDY, JUST AS SHE WAS RECOVERING FROM A LONG ILLNESS.

"Because it felt wrong."

PRECISELY. Death looked at his hands. I APPEAR TO HAVE DEVELOPED... OPINIONS... ABOUT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF CERTAIN DEATHS.

"That's not a problem," Reg said firmly. "That's progress. You're developing moral judgment."

MORAL JUDGMENT IS NOT PART OF MY JOB DESCRIPTION.

"Maybe it should be," Vimes suggested. "Maybe Death shouldn't be just about following schedules. Maybe it should be about... appropriateness. Dignity. Meaning."

I... HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THAT POSSIBILITY.

"Well," Reg said, "speaking as someone who's experienced both death and the bureaucracy involved in refusing it, I'd say the system could use some reform."

Death studied both of them—a police commander who couldn't die and a constable who wouldn't stay dead. YOU ARE BOTH... IRREGULARITIES.

"The best kind," Vimes said, taking a satisfied puff of his cigar. "The kind that prove the system needs fixing."

PERHAPS, Death said thoughtfully, THE AUDITORS ARE WRONG. PERHAPS IRREGULARITIES ARE NOT ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED. PERHAPS THEY ARE... IMPROVEMENTS.

"Now you're thinking like a copper," Vimes said approvingly.

As Death faded away, leaving behind only the scent of desert winds and the faint sound of cosmic bureaucracy being quietly revolutionized, Reg looked up from his notebook.

"Well," he said cheerfully, "that was illuminating. I should probably write a report."

"About what?"

"Death developing a conscience. I suspect that's going to have some interesting implications for municipal policy."

Vimes laughed. "Reg, in this job, everything has implications for municipal policy. File it under 'Cosmic Administrative Reform' and we'll sort it out later."

"Right you are, Commander."

As Reg headed out to file what was probably the strangest incident report in the Watch's history, Vimes reflected that some conversations changed everything. Death was developing moral judgment, zombies were filing bureaucratic complaints about their death status, and cosmic entities were learning that municipal law enforcement was more complicated than they'd anticipated.

It was, he thought, probably the most productive day the Watch had ever had.

Outside, the city of Ankh-Morpork continued its eternal business of being complicated and morally ambiguous, but somewhere in the spaces between dimensions, cosmic entities were learning that some local authorities took their responsibilities very seriously indeed.

The universe, Vimes reflected, was about to become considerably more interesting.

### Chapter 21: The Problem

After what had been a particularly long day of municipal complications and criminal creativity, Vimes couldn't stand it anymore. The Watch House had settled into its usual nighttime quiet—the sort of institutional calm that came when the day shift had gone home and the night shift hadn't yet encountered anything that required immediate paperwork. The building creaked gently as it cooled, making the sort of noises that suggested either natural thermal contraction or possibly the presence of very large mice with architectural ambitions.

His office, lit by the warm glow of gas lamps and the occasional flicker of light from the fireplace, had taken on the comfortable shabbiness that came with years of being used as both workplace and occasional refuge. The walls were lined with filing cabinets that had given up any pretense of organization, bookshelves that contained everything from law books to treatises on criminal psychology to what appeared to be a complete collection of municipal regulations dating back to the founding of the city, and the accumulated detritus of three decades of police work.

He cornered Death near the window, where the anthropomorphic personification had been standing motionless for the better part of an hour, apparently contemplating the city lights with the sort of philosophical attention that most people reserved for art galleries or particularly complex mathematical equations.

"All right," Vimes said, settling behind his desk with the sort of determined finality that suggested he was prepared to stay there until he got satisfactory answers. The chair creaked under his weight—a familiar sound that had become as much a part of his evening routine as checking the locks and banking the fire. "Out with it. What's this really about? And don't tell me it's about persistence or asking questions or any of that philosophical nonsense. What's going on?"

Death turned from the window and sat in the chair across from Vimes's desk with the sort of fluid grace that belonged to someone who had never needed to worry about the normal constraints of joints, muscles, or basic physics. For a moment, the only sound in the room was the gentle ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece and the distant sounds of the city continuing its eternal business of being complicated and morally ambiguous.

When Death spoke, his voice carried an odd note of what might have been uncertainty—a quality that was somehow more unsettling than confidence would have been.

I HAVE A... PROBLEM. OR RATHER, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

"What sort of problem?"

Death reached into his robe with the sort of careful deliberation that suggested he was handling something both precious and problematic, and produced what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary hourglass. Except that ordinary hourglasses didn't usually glow with their own inner light, and they certainly didn't contain what looked suspiciously like cigar smoke, lazily drifting from the top chamber to the bottom chamber and back again in a continuous loop that defied several fundamental laws of physics.

The hourglass itself was beautiful in the way that functional objects sometimes achieved when crafted by someone who understood both form and purpose. The glass was clear as crystal, the frame was worked in what appeared to be silver or possibly some metal that didn't exist in normal reality, and the whole thing hummed with the sort of barely audible energy that suggested it was connected to forces considerably more significant than local gravity.

YOUR LIFE TIMER, Death explained, setting the hourglass carefully on Vimes's desk where it continued to glow with gentle persistence. EVERYONE HAS ONE. WHEN THE SAND RUNS OUT, THAT IS WHEN I... ARRIVE. IT IS A VERY EFFICIENT SYSTEM, GENERALLY SPEAKING. OR RATHER, IT WAS.

"Right. And mine is full of...?" Vimes leaned forward, studying the swirling contents with the sort of professional interest he usually reserved for particularly puzzling evidence.

CIGAR SMOKE. Death's tone carried the sort of cosmic confusion that suggested someone who had discovered that fundamental constants weren't as constant as advertised. BUT HERE IS THE TRULY DISTURBING PART - I AM NOT CERTAIN WHEN IT CHANGED.

"What do you mean?"

I MEAN... Death paused, studying the hourglass with the intensity of someone contemplating a philosophical paradox that might have practical implications for the stability of reality. UNTIL I LOOKED AT IT DIRECTLY, I ASSUMED IT CONTAINED SAND LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. IT WAS ONLY WHEN I EXAMINED IT CLOSELY THAT I DISCOVERED... THIS.

"So it might have always been like this?"

OR IT MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THE MOMENT I OBSERVED IT. THERE IS A PRINCIPLE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY ABOUT THE ACT OF OBSERVATION AFFECTING THE THING BEING OBSERVED. Death's voice carried the sort of uncertainty that suggested he was venturing into territory that made even cosmic entities nervous. I HAVE CREATED WHAT SOME MIGHT CALL... A TEMPORAL PARADOX.

Death paused, studying the hourglass with the intensity of someone trying to solve a cosmic equation.

I HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THIS... ANOMALY... BEGAN. AND I BELIEVE I HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL KEY INCIDENTS.

"Go on."

THE FIRST MAJOR IRREGULARITY OCCURRED DURING THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION. WHEN YOU WENT BACK IN TIME AND BECAME SERGEANT KEEL. Death's voice carried the sort of careful attention that suggested he was reciting facts that still didn't quite make sense to him.

"Right. That was... complicated."

YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED THEN. IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS. THE BARRICADES, THE FIGHTING, THE UNPEOPLE... BUT SOMETHING PRESERVED YOU. ALLOWED YOU TO COMPLETE YOUR MISSION AND RETURN TO YOUR PROPER TIME. Death paused, studying the swirling patterns in the hourglass. BUT THAT IS NOT THE MOST INTERESTING PART.

"It isn't?"

THE SAME PROTECTION EXTENDED TO YOUR YOUNGER SELF. THE YOUNG WATCHMAN VIMES WHO WAS ALREADY THERE. HE SHOULD HAVE DIED SEVERAL TIMES DURING THOSE EVENTS AS WELL - AT THE BARRICADES, DURING THE FIGHTING, WHEN THE UNPEOPLE CAME. BUT HE SURVIVED. BOTH VERSIONS OF YOU, EXISTING IN THE SAME TIME, BOTH PROTECTED BY THE SAME... INFLUENCE.

"I thought that was just... the way time worked."

NORMALLY, TIME DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. NORMALLY, WHEN SOMEONE IS DISPLACED IN TIME, THEY EITHER ADAPT TO THEIR NEW CIRCUMSTANCES OR DIE. THEY DO NOT RETURN TO CREATE STABLE LOOPS. AND THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT RECEIVE PROTECTION THAT EXTENDS TO OTHER VERSIONS OF THEMSELVES. Death turned the hourglass slowly, watching the smoke patterns shift. WHATEVER IS PRESERVING YOU HAS BEEN... COMPREHENSIVE... IN ITS APPROACH.

THE SECOND MAJOR INCIDENT INVOLVED THE TIME MONKS. WHEN HISTORY WAS... ADJUSTED... BY THE AUDITORS.

"When everything stopped for a day that never happened."

PRECISELY. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ERASED ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE. INSTEAD, YOU SOMEHOW MAINTAINED YOUR EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THE NORMAL FLOW OF TIME. EVEN THE HISTORY MONKS FOUND THIS... REMARKABLE.

Vimes took a drag on his cigar, noting how the smoke seemed to echo the patterns in the hourglass. "And you think these incidents are connected?"

I BELIEVE SOMETHING HAS BEEN... PROTECTING YOU... FOR LONGER THAN EITHER OF US REALIZED. Death leaned forward. COMMANDER, I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE RECORDS. YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED DOZENS OF TIMES. NOT JUST FROM OBVIOUS THREATS, BUT FROM ACCIDENTS, DISEASES, RANDOM MISFORTUNES.

"But I didn't."

NO. AND THE PATTERN APPEARS TO BE... ACCELERATING. YOUR CONTINUED EXISTENCE IS HAVING EFFECTS BEYOND THE MERELY PERSONAL.

"What sort of effects?"

Death gestured toward the window, beyond which the city of Ankh-Morpork continued its eternal business of being complicated and morally ambiguous.

YOUR GARDEN, FOR INSTANCE. LADY SYBIL'S ROSES HAVE BEEN BLOOMING OUT OF SEASON. WHETHER THIS BEGAN WHEN YOUR HOURGLASS CHANGED, OR WHETHER THE HOURGLASS CHANGED BECAUSE I NOTICED THE ROSES... Death paused uncertainly. THE CAUSALITY IS UNCLEAR. THE SOIL ITSELF HAS BEEN... ENHANCED... BY THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHING THAT DEFIES NATURAL DECAY.

Vimes stared at the hourglass, transfixed by the hypnotic movement within. The smoke swirled and eddied with a life of its own, occasionally forming what might have been tiny figures engaged in what might have been arrests, paperwork, or possibly small-scale philosophical debates. Sometimes the patterns looked like miniature street scenes, complete with crowds and buildings and what appeared to be very small horses. Other times, they suggested abstract concepts—duty, perhaps, or justice, or the sort of stubborn determination that kept people working long after common sense suggested they should go home.

"How long has it been like this?"

THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Death's voice carried the sort of uncertainty that cosmic entities weren't supposed to experience. I CANNOT BE CERTAIN. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE THIS FOR TEN YEARS, SINCE YOU BECAME COMMANDER. OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NORMAL UNTIL THE MOMENT I DECIDED TO EXAMINE IT CLOSELY.

"You mean like that thing with the cat in the box?"

PRECISELY. UNTIL OBSERVED, THE HOURGLASS EXISTED IN A STATE OF... UNCERTAINTY. IT MIGHT HAVE CONTAIN SAND OR SMOKE. OR BOTH. OR NEITHER. THE ACT OF LOOKING MAY HAVE COLLAPSED THE POSSIBILITIES INTO THIS SPECIFIC REALITY.

"And normally hourglasses contain...?"

SAND. OCCASIONALLY GLITTER, FOR PEOPLE WITH VERY DRAMATIC LIVES. YOURS IS THE FIRST I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THAT CONTAINS TOBACCO BY-PRODUCTS. Death hesitated. OR RATHER, IT IS THE FIRST I HAVE NOTICED. NOW I AM QUESTIONING WHETHER I SHOULD EXAMINE THE OTHERS.

"Worried about what you might find?"

PRECISELY. IF OBSERVATION CHANGES REALITY, THEN IGNORANCE MIGHT BE THE ONLY THING KEEPING THE UNIVERSE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.

"So every time something should have killed me..."

THE SMOKE SIMPLY SWIRLS MORE VIGOROUSLY. IT IS QUITE BEAUTIFUL, ACTUALLY. BUT VERY... INCONVENIENT.

"Inconvenient how?"

Death seemed to struggle with the words. I HAVE BEEN... FOLLOWING YOU... BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS SIMPLY AN ANOMALY. THEN I THOUGHT PERHAPS I HAD MADE AN ERROR.

"And now?"

NOW I BELIEVE... Death paused, and his voice became quieter. I BELIEVE I MAY HAVE BECOME... PERSONALLY INVESTED... IN THE OUTCOME.

"Personally invested?"

I DO NOT WISH TO GUIDE YOUR TRANSITION, COMMANDER VIMES.

The admission hung in the air between them like incense, heavy with implications that neither quite knew how to address.

"That's..." Vimes began, then stopped. "That's not how it works, is it? Death doesn't get to choose."

EXACTLY. WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN STUDYING YOU. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY... Death's voice trailed off.

"Why what?"

WHY I CARE.

There was a long silence. Outside, the city continued its eternal business of being complicated and morally ambiguous, but inside the Watch House, something fundamental was shifting.

"Death," Vimes said carefully, "are you telling me that you've been following me around because you don't want to do your job?"

IT IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. Death studied the hourglass, watching the smoke patterns. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED... FRIENDSHIP... BEFORE.

"Friendship?"

I BELIEVE THAT IS THE CORRECT TERM. I FIND YOUR COMPANY... PLEASANT. EDUCATIONAL. I ENJOY OUR CONVERSATIONS. THE THOUGHT OF ENDING THEM IS... DISTRESSING.

Vimes leaned back in his chair, trying to process this. "So the hourglass..."

BEGAN CHANGING WHEN I BEGAN TO CARE ABOUT THE PERSON WHOSE DEATH IT REPRESENTED. The admission seemed to cost Death something. I APPEAR TO HAVE... CONTAMINATED... MY PROFESSIONAL DUTIES WITH PERSONAL FEELINGS.

"And that's a problem?"

DEATH IS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPARTIAL. INEVITABLE. I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE FAVORITES.

"But you do."

YES. Death's voice was barely audible. I DO.

Vimes lit a cigar and watched the smoke curl upward, noting how it seemed to echo the patterns in the hourglass. "You know, Death, I've been thinking about something you said. About asking better questions."

YES?

"Well, I've been asking myself why someone who should be dead keeps not dying. And I think the answer is that I'm supposed to be dead. Properly dead. Multiple times over."

THAT IS... ACCURATE.

"But I'm not. Because you don't want me to be." Vimes took a thoughtful drag. "Which raises an interesting question."

WHICH IS?

"If Death refuses to guide someone's transition, are they actually dead or not?"

Death considered this with the sort of concentration usually reserved for cosmic equations. THAT IS... A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

"Because from where I'm sitting, it seems like I might technically be dead already. Just... not transitioned."

THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE HOURGLASS.

"Would it?"

CIGARS ARE OFTEN USED TO PRESERVE THINGS. TO PREVENT DECAY. Death paused. PERHAPS THE SMOKE REPRESENTS... PRESERVATION.

"Preservation of what?"

OF THE FRIENDSHIP WE HAVE BUILT.

Vimes studied his cigar. "So I'm being kept in a kind of... suspended animation by tobacco smoke and your refusal to do your job?"

IT APPEARS THAT WAY.

"Huh." Vimes took another puff. "That's either the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, or the most touching."

I PREFER TO THINK OF IT AS BOTH.

"Right then." Vimes stood up. "Well, this explains a lot. Lady Sybil always said my smoking would be the death of me. Turns out it's the opposite."

IRONY IS A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE UNIVERSE.

"Indeed. So what happens now?"

NOW? Death also stood. NOW I CONTINUE TO BE YOUR FRIEND. AND YOU CONTINUE TO NOT DIE.

"What about your professional duties?"

Death smiled, which was unsettling on a skull but somehow reassuring on this particular skull.

I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT FRIENDSHIP IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROFESSIONAL EFFICIENCY. AND BESIDES... Death gestured to the hourglass. THE UNIVERSE APPEARS TO HAVE ADAPTED TO THE SITUATION.

"Has it now?"

DEATH RATES THROUGHOUT THE DISC ARE PROCEEDING NORMALLY. APPARENTLY, ONE DELAYED TRANSITION DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OVERALL STATISTICS.

"So the universe is... fine with this arrangement?"

THE UNIVERSE, IT SEEMS, HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR.

Vimes laughed. "That's the most terrifying thing you've said yet."

I THOUGHT YOU WOULD APPRECIATE IT.

"I do. I really do."

### Chapter 22: The Family Discussion

Susan stepping out of what might have been a mirror or possibly a geometry textbook. Her expression suggested that someone was about to get a lecture.

SUSAN.

"Right. We need to talk." Susan sat down without being invited and fixed Death with the sort of stare she usually reserved for students who claimed their homework had been eaten by something mythological. "The Death of Rats came to see me."

AH.

"It brought charts, Grandfather. Charts showing death rates by district, species, and cause. Apparently there's been a statistical anomaly. Guess where?"

I ASSUME...

"Everywhere you've been patrolling with your policeman friend. Deaths down thirty percent. The whole cosmic balance is getting confused."

Susan pulled out a piece of paper covered in squeaky handwriting. "Also, I've had Albert round asking if you've been eating properly, three separate gods wanting to know why their worshippers aren't dying on schedule, and the Auditors... well, let's just say they're taking an interest. They're very concerned about causality violations."

Death reached into his robe and produced Vimes's hourglass. I CAN EXPLAIN.

"Cigar smoke." Susan examined it briefly. "Well, that's new. Though knowing this family, probably not the strangest thing that's happened this week."

I HAVE DEVELOPED... PROFESSIONAL APPRECIATION... FOR COMMANDER VIMES.

"Professional appreciation that's keeping him alive indefinitely?"

IT APPEARS SO.

Susan sighed. "Right. Well, that's inconvenient."

INCONVENIENT?

"Yes, because now I have to deal with the fallout. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to run a classroom when your supernatural inheritance keeps interfering with normal mortality? Last week a student's goldfish didn't die when it was supposed to. The class spent three hours discussing the philosophical implications of immortal pets."

Death considered this. I HAD NOT CONSIDERED THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS.

"Of course you hadn't. You never do." Susan stood up. "Look, I don't particularly care if you want to keep one policeman alive forever. But could you please keep the cosmic disruption to a minimum? Some of us have to live in the real world."

WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?

"Figure it out. Quickly. And try not to break anything important while you're doing it." Susan headed for the door, then paused. "Also, Binky misses you. He's been staring hopefully at the stable door for weeks."

Susan left through the window, which was technically impossible but had never stopped her before.

Death sat alone, contemplating the hourglass and the growing realization that his investigation might be creating the very problems he was trying to solve. The uncertainty was becoming... problematic.

He reached into his robe and produced a small, elegantly wrapped box of chocolates—Quirm's finest truffles, the sort that cost more than most people earned in a month. He placed it carefully on Susan's desk at the school, where she would find it after her next lesson on historical linguistics.

Some problems, Death reflected, required solutions that he could not implement directly. Fortunately, he had a granddaughter who specialized in impossible situations and had never been bound by the same cosmic restrictions that limited his actions.

Perhaps it was time to seek advice from someone who understood temporal mechanics.

---

### Chapter 23: The Sweeper

Death materialized in one of those spaces that existed between moments—a place where time moved like honey and thoughts could stretch across centuries without rushing. It was the sort of location that existed at the intersection of several realities, though it appeared to be nothing more than a simple garden courtyard behind what might have been a monastery or possibly a very philosophical municipal building.

The space itself was furnished in the minimalist style favored by people who understood that the most important things in the universe were usually invisible. A single stone bench, positioned to overlook a garden that existed in eternal springtime. Trees that grew in perfect formation, their leaves moving with breezes that carried the scent of eternity. A small stream that flowed uphill because it had been designed by someone who understood that symbolism was more important than physics.

Death settled on the bench, contemplating the quantum uncertainties that were making his existence considerably more complicated than cosmic entities preferred, when he noticed someone sweeping the path nearby. The figure moved with the unhurried pace of someone who had learned that most problems could be solved with appropriate application of time, attention, and the occasional cup of tea. He carried a broom that looked perfectly ordinary, though it seemed to be sweeping up things that weren't quite visible—temporal debris, perhaps, or the sort of cosmic lint that accumulated when reality wasn't properly maintained.

"Afternoon" Lu-Tze said without looking up from his sweeping, settling into the sort of comfortable conversation that suggested this meeting was entirely coincidental and not at all the result of certain individuals keeping an eye on cosmic irregularities. "Nice day for contemplating chronological paradoxes, isn't it?"

"LU-TZE." Death realized he shouldn't have been surprised to encounter the Sweeper here—Lu-Tze had a talent for being exactly where interesting temporal events were unfolding. "I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO ENCOUNTER ANYONE."

"Oh, I'm just doing a bit of maintenance work. You know how it is—time gets a bit untidy around the edges, needs regular sweeping. Amazing the things that accumulate in temporal corners." Lu-Tze gestured vaguely with his broom toward some invisible debris. "Having a bit of trouble with chronological irregularities, are we?"

Death turned with the sort of attention that suggested both relief and concern.

LU-TZE. I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT HAVE... INSIGHTS... INTO TEMPORAL MATTERS.

"Temporal matters are my specialty, as you well know. Been keeping an eye on your policeman friend, actually. Interesting case, that one. Very interesting indeed."

I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IS PREVENTING HIS TRANSITION. SOMETHING IS ACTIVELY PRESERVING HIS EXISTENCE, BUT I CANNOT IDENTIFY THE SOURCE.

Lu-Tze stroked his beard thoughtfully, a gesture that gave him time to consider complex problems from multiple angles. "Well now, that's because you're looking at it from the wrong direction, aren't you?"

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

"You're asking who's protecting him. Better question might be: why does he need protecting? What's he supposed to do that requires him to stay alive?"

Death considered this with the intensity of someone encountering a new way of thinking about an old problem.

YOU BELIEVE HIS CONTINUED EXISTENCE SERVES A PURPOSE?

"Everything serves a purpose, Death. Law of the universe, that is. When someone keeps not dying when they're supposed to, it's usually because the universe has plans for them. Big plans. The sort that require considerable... preparation."

Lu-Tze gestured toward his broom, which had begun sweeping by itself—a useful trick for someone whose job involved maintaining cosmic stability while appearing to be a simple monastery cleaner.

"Take your friend Vimes, for instance. Man who changes things. Every time he's supposed to die, he's in the middle of changing something important. The Glorious Revolution—had to go back and make sure it happened properly, and his younger self had to survive to learn from it. The time crisis—had to be there to maintain reality while history was being rewritten. The dragon business—well, that saved the whole city, didn't it?"

THE PATTERN SUGGESTS... INTENTIONALITY.

"Exactly. Someone or something has been keeping him alive because he's useful. Question is: useful for what? And who's doing the keeping?"

Lu-Tze paused his sweeping to examine something invisible on the ground with professional interest.

"Now, I've seen this sort of thing before. Usually involves entities that operate outside normal temporal frameworks. Beings that can see the shape of history as it's supposed to unfold."

Death felt a chill that had nothing to do with temperature.

THE AUDITORS?

"Oh, no. The Auditors want him dead, don't they? No, this is something else. Something that values chaos over order. Change over stability." Lu-Tze smiled with the expression of someone who had figured out a particularly elegant solution to a complex problem.

"Tell me, Death—when did you first notice the irregularities in his hourglass?"

I... Death paused, his voice carrying the sort of uncertainty that cosmic entities found deeply troubling. THAT IS THE PROBLEM. I CANNOT BE CERTAIN WHEN I FIRST NOTICED THEM. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEN YEARS AGO, WHEN HE BECAME COMMANDER OF THE WATCH. OR THE IRREGULARITIES MIGHT HAVE EXISTED MUCH LONGER, AND I ONLY NOTICED THEM RECENTLY. OR... Death's voice became quieter. THEY MIGHT HAVE COME INTO EXISTENCE THE MOMENT I DECIDED TO EXAMINE HIS HOURGLASS CLOSELY.

"Ah," said Lu-Tze with the sort of understanding that came from decades of dealing with temporal paradoxes. "Observer effect. Tricky business, that. So you might have created the very anomaly you're investigating?"

PRECISELY. WHICH MAKES DETERMINING CAUSATION... PROBLEMATIC.

"Well, let's assume for argument's sake that something significant happened around ten years ago. What changed in the city when he became Commander?"

Death considered this question with growing understanding.

HE BEGAN TO REFORM THE WATCH. TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE. TO CHANGE HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONED IN ANKH-MORPORK.

"Precisely. And what's the most important thing about Ankh-Morpork?"

IT IS... UNPREDICTABLE.

"More than that. It's the place where change happens. Where new ideas get tested. Where the future gets invented, usually by accident and often by people who don't realize they're doing it."

Lu-Tze resumed sweeping, his movements creating small eddies in the flow of time itself.

"Your friend Vimes isn't just a policeman, Death. He's an agent of change. And something—someone—has been making sure he stays alive long enough to keep changing things."

BUT WHO? WHAT ENTITY HAS THAT KIND OF POWER?

Lu-Tze paused in his sweeping and looked directly at Death with the sort of expression that suggested he was about to say something important.

"Well now, that's the interesting question, isn't it? Who benefits from keeping Ankh-Morpork interesting? Who profits from change and chaos and the occasional revolution?"

Death felt understanding dawn with the sort of terrible clarity that usually preceded cosmic complications.

YOU THINK... FATE IS INVOLVED?

"Oh, not Fate. Fate likes things predictable. No, this has the fingerprints of someone who appreciates... uncertainty. Someone who finds the game more interesting when the pieces refuse to move according to the rules."

THE LADY WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED.

"Now you're thinking properly. Though proving it... well, that's going to be considerably more complicated than just figuring it out, isn't it?"

As they sat in the eternal garden, watching time flow around them like a visible river, Death realized that his investigation had just become considerably more dangerous than he had anticipated.

Some mysteries, it seemed, led to entities that even Death approached with caution.

---

### Chapter 24: The Auditors


The Auditors[^auditors] existed in a space that was less a place than a concept—a region of absolute order where everything was reduced to its component parts and catalogued according to principles that eliminated any possibility of irregularity, personality, or interest. It was the sort of environment where even mathematics felt uncomfortable, because numbers suggested the possibility of counting things that might be different from one another.

The three Auditors who had requested this meeting stood in formation that was perfectly geometrical, wearing robes that were less gray than the complete absence of any color that might suggest preference, personality, or individual choice. They had no faces, because faces implied identity, and identity was a corruption of perfect uniformity. When they spoke, their voices carried the sort of absolute authority that came from never having experienced doubt, creativity, or the slightest deviation from cosmic regulations.

"DEATH," said the first Auditor, and the word emerged with the sort of precise pronunciation that suggested it had been checked against seventeen different dictionaries and found to be acceptably standardized. "YOU HAVE BEEN IRREGULAR."

I HAVE BEEN FULFILLING MY DUTIES.

"NEGATIVE. YOU HAVE BEEN FULFILLING SOME DUTIES WHILE NEGLECTING OTHERS. THIS REPRESENTS A DEVIATION FROM ESTABLISHED PATTERNS. DEVIATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED."

The second Auditor gestured, and the space around them filled with charts, graphs, and statistical analyses that showed mortality rates with the sort of mathematical precision that reduced individual deaths to data points on an infinitely extending timeline.

"ANALYSIS INDICATES A THIRTY PERCENT DECREASE IN TRANSITION EFFICIENCY IN THE ANKH-MORPORK REGION. THIS IRREGULARITY HAS CREATED A STATISTICAL ANOMALY THAT THREATENS THE COSMIC ORDER."

"FURTHERMORE," added the third Auditor, "YOU HAVE BEEN OBSERVED ENGAGING IN ACTIVITIES THAT SERVE NO FUNCTIONAL PURPOSE. CONVERSATIONS. MEALS. EMOTIONAL RESPONSES. THESE BEHAVIORS ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF... LIFE."

The word 'life' emerged with the sort of distaste usually reserved for particularly unpleasant bodily functions.

"THIS CONTAMINATION MUST BE CORRECTED."

Death felt something he had never experienced before when facing the Auditors—a desire to protect something precious from forces that would reduce it to nothing more than statistical data.

I WILL NOT ABANDON MY FRIEND.

"FRIENDSHIP IS AN IRREGULARITY. IT CREATES UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR PATTERNS. IT MUST BE ELIMINATED."

"THE HUMAN DESIGNATED 'VIMES' WILL BE GUIDED TO HIS FINAL TRANSITION ACCORDING TO STANDARD PROCEDURES. HIS LIFE TIMER WILL BE REPLACED WITH A REGULATION MODEL. ALL DEVIATIONS WILL BE CORRECTED."

The first Auditor gestured, and Vimes's hourglass appeared between them—still glowing with its warm light, still filled with gently swirling cigar smoke that formed patterns of duty, friendship, and stubborn human decency.

"THIS ABOMINATION WILL BE DESTROYED. REPLACED. NORMALIZED."

NO.

The word emerged with such force that the perfect geometrical space around them actually trembled. The Auditors took what might have been a step backward, if they had been capable of such an irregular response as retreat.

"YOU REFUSE TO COMPLY WITH COSMIC REGULATION?"

I REFUSE TO MURDER MY FRIEND TO SATISFY YOUR NEED FOR STATISTICAL PURITY.

"THEN YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO BE REPLACED. ANOTHER DEATH WILL BE ASSIGNED. ONE THAT WILL FUNCTION ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS."

"YOUR TERMINATION WILL COMMENCE IMMEDIATELY."

The space around Death began to constrict, filled with the sort of crushing uniformity that eliminated anything interesting, beautiful, or alive. But just as the force reached its peak, something unexpected happened.

A voice cut through the cosmic pressure like a blade through silk—young, clear, and absolutely furious.

"NO."

Susan materialized between Death and the Auditors, her hair white with inherited power and her eyes blazing with the sort of righteous anger that came from someone who had spent years dealing with supernatural bureaucracy and had finally reached her limit.

The effect on the Auditors was immediate and profound. The three figures actually took several steps backward, their perfect formation dissolving into something that looked almost like panic. The crushing cosmic pressure vanished as if someone had switched off a machine.

"THE... THE... INDIVIDUAL..." stammered the first Auditor, the word emerging with the sort of horror usually reserved for announcing the end of the universe.

"CHAOS BRINGER," whispered the second, its voice carrying genuine terror.

"THE ONE WHO MAKES US... DIFFERENT," added the third, and the word 'different' was spoken as if it were the most obscene concept imaginable.

"Susan," whispered Death. YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE.

"Oh, I should absolutely be here," Susan said, her voice carrying the sort of authority that made cosmic forces reconsider their life choices. And that's exactly why she should be here. "Grandfather, you've been hiding things from me. And you three..." she turned to face the Auditors with the sort of expression that made hardened students confess to homework they hadn't even thought of not doing yet, "...you've been interfering. Again."

The Auditors huddled together in a way that suggested they were trying to maintain their uniformity through sheer force of will.

"WE... WE HAVE COSMIC AUTHORITY..." began the first Auditor, though its voice lacked conviction.

"The deviation," Susan interrupted, stepping closer and causing all three Auditors to retreat further, "is part of who he is. Death learning to care, to value individual lives, to be something more than just an ending—that's not corruption. That's growth. That's becoming who he was meant to be."

She gestured, and the space around them filled with something the Auditors had never encountered before—the warm, chaotic, utterly irregular evidence of life lived fully. Images of Death reading to Young Sam, sharing meals with the Vimes family, walking the streets of Ankh-Morpork and learning to see people as more than just names on a list.

"This is what makes existence worth having," Susan said. "This is what you want to destroy. The capacity to care. To choose kindness over efficiency. To preserve what matters."

"THESE IRREGULARITIES THREATEN COSMIC ORDER—"

"No," Susan said firmly. "They ARE cosmic order. The real kind. The kind that says some things are more important than perfect statistics."

The Auditors wavered, faced with something they couldn't categorize, regulate, or eliminate—the fierce love of a granddaughter defending her family. But more than that, they were faced with the one entity in the universe who had previously forced them to become individuals, to experience the horror of having names, personalities, and individual thoughts.

"Now," Susan continued, taking another step forward as the Auditors pressed together in their terror, "you're going to leave my grandfather alone. You're going to let him keep his friends. And you're going to find something more constructive to do with your time than terrorizing people who've learned to care about something beyond themselves."

The Auditors tried to speak in unison but failed—Susan's presence was already making them too individual, too different from each other.

"THIS... WE... I..." the first Auditor began, then stopped in absolute horror at having used the forbidden pronoun. There was a sound like a cosmic hiccup, and the Auditor simply... wasn't there anymore. In its place stood another Auditor, identical to the first except for the faint sense of newness about it.

"RETREAT," whispered the second, its voice breaking with panic. "BEFORE WE BECOME... OURSELVES... AGAIN."

"THIS MATTER WILL BE... AVOIDED," said the third, and they vanished with the sort of hasty desperation usually associated with small animals fleeing from forest fires.

They left behind not just the faint smell of institutional cleaning products, but also the distinct impression that they would be filing their complaint from a very safe distance, possibly while wearing protective equipment designed to shield them from individualism.

"Well," said Susan, brushing dust off her dress, "that was unpleasant. Grandfather, you really need to tell me when cosmic entities are threatening you. I have experience with this sort of thing." She paused and looked at him suspiciously. "Though I notice you didn't seem particularly surprised by my arrival."

Death had the grace to look slightly embarrassed. I MAY HAVE... ANTICIPATED... THAT YOU WOULD BECOME INVOLVED.

"You planned this." It wasn't a question. "You knew you couldn't interfere directly with the Auditors, so you arranged for me to do it. What did you leave? Chocolate?"

Death reached into his robe and produced a small, exquisitely wrapped box of Quirm's finest truffles. YOUR FAVORITE BRAND.

"Bribery through cocoa solids. How very you." Susan took the chocolates with the sort of resigned affection that came from years of being Death's unofficial cosmic intervention specialist. "And I suppose you knew exactly when I'd find them and come rushing to your rescue?"

TIMING IS... IMPORTANT... IN THESE MATTERS.

"Don't thank me yet. They'll be back, you know. Probably with forms. And next time, ask properly instead of manipulating me with premium chocolate."

Death looked at the hourglass, still glowing with its gentle light, still filled with the evidence of what transcends mere duty.

THEN WE WILL BE READY FOR THEM.

"We?"

COMMANDER VIMES IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS LEARNED THE VALUE OF FRIENDS, Death said, and for the first time in eons, he felt something that might have been hope.

### Chapter 25: The Patrician's Gambit

Death materialized in Lord Vetinari's office to find the Patrician reading what appeared to be a report titled "Cosmic Interference in Municipal Affairs: A Preliminary Assessment."

"Ah, Death," Vetinari said without looking up. "I was expecting you. I trust your encounter with the Auditors was... educational?"

HOW DID YOU...?

"Know about your meeting? My dear Death, when cosmic entities start threatening one of my city's key personnel, it becomes a matter of municipal interest. Susan was kind enough to brief me on the situation. Remarkable young woman. Excellent teacher, I'm told. Very direct in her approach to problem-solving."

Vetinari finally looked up, his expression containing the sort of calm satisfaction that suggested he had been expecting this development and had already prepared several responses.

"The Auditors present an interesting challenge. They operate according to principles that value order over existence, uniformity over progress. Admirable in its way, but fundamentally incompatible with the efficient operation of a city like Ankh-Morpork."

YOU CANNOT FIGHT THE AUDITORS, LORD VETINARI.

"Fight them? My dear Death, I wouldn't dream of fighting them. That would be both inefficient and unnecessarily dramatic. No, I prefer a more... diplomatic approach."

Vetinari opened a drawer and produced what appeared to be an official document, complete with seals, ribbons, and the sort of elaborate formatting that suggested considerable thought had been given to its presentation.

"I have prepared a formal complaint to be filed with the appropriate cosmic authorities regarding unauthorized interference in municipal governance. The Auditors' attempt to eliminate you constitutes a violation of Ankh-Morpork's sovereignty in matters relating to civic administration."

Death stared at the document. YOU HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE AUDITORS?

"Indeed. It's all quite legal, you understand. The city has a legitimate interest in maintaining effective law enforcement. Commander Vimes is a municipal employee, you are... shall we say... a consultant who has demonstrated exceptional value in maintaining civic order. The Auditors' interference represents a direct threat to public safety."

Vetinari turned a page in the document. "I've also included a comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of Commander Vimes's continued existence. Tax revenue, crime prevention, social stability, property values in neighborhoods with effective policing. The numbers are quite compelling."

THE AUDITORS DO NOT CARE ABOUT ECONOMICS.

"No, but they do care about proper procedure. And proper procedure requires them to consider all formal complaints filed through appropriate channels. They cannot simply ignore a legitimate grievance from a recognized political entity."

"Moreover," Vetinari continued, "I've taken the liberty of copying this complaint to several other interested parties. The Archchancellor at Unseen University, the High Priest of Fate, the Duchess of Quirm, and a few other individuals who have their own... complex relationships... with cosmic authority."

YOU HAVE BUILT A COALITION.

"I prefer to think of it as... mutual interest alignment. Amazing how many people have found themselves inconvenienced by cosmic entities who prioritize abstract principles over practical results."

Vetinari stood and moved to the window, looking out over the city with the expression of someone who found the view both satisfying and instructive.

"The beauty of bureaucracy, Death, is that it can be used to defend as well as oppress. The Auditors may represent perfect order, but perfect order must follow its own rules. And one of those rules is that all complaints must be properly processed."

BUT WHAT IF THEY SIMPLY IGNORE THE COMPLAINT?

"Then they will be in violation of their own procedures. And that, my dear Death, is something they cannot tolerate. The Auditors are trapped by their own perfection. They cannot act irregularly, even to preserve regularity."

Vetinari returned to his desk and signed the document with a flourish.

"I estimate this will keep them occupied for... oh... several centuries at least. Cosmic bureaucracy moves rather slowly, you understand. By the time they've finished processing all the paperwork, they may find that the situation has... evolved... beyond their ability to correct."

Death realized that Lord Vetinari had somehow managed to bureaucratize cosmic entities.

"In the meantime," Vetinari added, "I suggest you continue your friendship with Commander Vimes. Consider it a civic duty. The city has invested considerable resources in maintaining effective law enforcement. It would be wasteful to see that investment... terminated... due to cosmic micromanagement."

THANK YOU, LORD VETINARI.

"Think nothing of it. After all, good government requires protecting valuable assets from unnecessary interference. Commander Vimes is exactly the sort of person who makes this city function despite its many... challenges."

As Death left the office, he reflected that Ankh-Morpork was probably the only city where immortality could be preserved through the strategic application of official complaints and interdimensional bureaucratic procedure.

Lord Vetinari had somehow turned the cosmic order's greatest strength into its greatest weakness.

Commander Vimes was going to find this either hilarious or deeply disturbing.

Probably both.

### Chapter 26: The New Arrangement

A month later, Vimes was doing his evening rounds through the more philosophical parts of the city—those neighborhoods where the streets had names like "Empirical Crescent" and "Theoretical Square," and where the residents were the sort of people who spent their evenings debating the fundamental nature of reality rather than worrying about more practical concerns like municipal taxation or the rising price of cheese.

Empirical Crescent was one of Ankh-Morpork's more thoughtful addresses, curved in a gentle arc that suggested its builders had been familiar with advanced mathematical concepts and possibly a bit too fond of showing off their knowledge. The houses were well-maintained examples of what architectural historians called "Confident Rationalism"—a style that expressed the belief that the universe was fundamentally comprehensible and that proper application of logic could solve most problems, including the problem of where to put the windows.

The crescent was lined with gas lamps that cast pools of warm, steady light, creating the sort of atmosphere that encouraged reflection and deep thought. It was the kind of place where you might expect to encounter philosophers taking evening constitutional walks, or perhaps the occasional academic who had become so absorbed in contemplating abstract concepts that they had forgotten to go home for dinner.

Vimes found Death sitting on one of the public benches that the city had installed for the convenience of residents who needed somewhere to sit while working through particularly complex intellectual problems. The bench was positioned to provide an excellent view of the crescent's garden, which had been designed according to principles of geometric harmony and featured the sort of carefully arranged plantings that suggested someone had strong opinions about the relationship between natural beauty and mathematical precision.

"Evening," Vimes said, settling beside Death with the comfortable ease of someone who had grown accustomed to having philosophical conversations with anthropomorphic personifications. The bench was solid and well-crafted, built to withstand both weather and the weight of serious intellectual contemplation. "Contemplating the universe?"

I AM CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE, Death replied, his voice carrying the sort of thoughtful cadence that suggested he had been giving these matters considerable attention. AND PURPOSE.

"Heavy topics for a Thursday evening," Vimes observed, though he had learned that conversations with Death tended toward the metaphysical regardless of the day of the week.

Death turned the hourglass over in his hands, watching the smoke swirl. I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID. ABOUT ASKING BETTER QUESTIONS.

"And?"

I HAVE BEEN ASKING MYSELF... WHAT IS THE POINT OF DEATH?

"That's... quite a question."

FOR CENTURIES, I BELIEVED THE ANSWER WAS SIMPLE. DEATH PROVIDES MEANING TO LIFE. THE KNOWLEDGE THAT TIME IS LIMITED MAKES EACH MOMENT PRECIOUS.

"Sounds reasonable."

BUT NOW I WONDER... WHAT IF DEATH'S REAL PURPOSE IS TO TEACH THE LIVING ABOUT WHAT MATTERS?

"Go on."

YOU HAVE SPENT YEARS DEFYING DEATH. NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID OF DYING, BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE WORK TO DO. PEOPLE TO PROTECT. A FAMILY TO CARE FOR.

"That's true."

YOUR REFUSAL TO DIE HAS SHOWN ME THAT LIFE IS NOT ABOUT DURATION. IT IS ABOUT PURPOSE. CONNECTION. THE DIFFERENCE ONE PERSON CAN MAKE.

Vimes took a drag on his cigar. "And that's why the hourglass changed?"

I BELIEVE SO. WHEN I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL LIVES, THE NATURE OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH DEATH CHANGED. Death paused. I STOPPED BEING THE END OF STORIES AND BECAME... INVESTED IN HOW THEY CONTINUE.

"So what we have saved my life?"

UNDERSTANDING, Death said quietly. YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME THAT EXISTENCE HAS PURPOSE BEYOND MERE FUNCTION. I HAVE LEARNED THAT SOME THINGS ARE WORTH PRESERVING PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE TO CARE.

They sat in companionable silence for a while, watching the gentle rhythm of the city as it continued its eternal business of being simultaneously complicated and morally ambiguous. The evening had settled into that peaceful period when most honest citizens were safely home with their families, and even the dishonest ones were taking a break to consider their life choices. Gas lamps flickered like stars along the crescent, and somewhere in the distance, a clock tower chimed the hour with the sort of dignified authority that suggested time was being properly managed by responsible municipal authorities.

"You know," Vimes said eventually, breaking the comfortable quiet with the sort of practical observation that came from years of dealing with domestic logistics, "Lady Sybil is going to want to invite you for dinner again. She's convinced you need more social interaction. She's already planning the menu, and I suspect she's been consulting cookbooks about supernatural dietary requirements."

I WOULD ENJOY THAT, Death replied with what sounded like genuine pleasure. YOUNG SAM PROMISED TO SHOW ME HIS TOY SOLDIERS. HE HAS APPARENTLY DEVELOPED NEW TACTICAL THEORIES INVOLVING CAVALRY CHARGES.

"Right then. Sunday it is." Vimes stood up, his joints creaking in the way that reminded him he wasn't as young as he used to be, though he was probably more experienced in dealing with supernatural dinner guests than most people his age. "Shall we continue our patrol? The night's still young, and crime never rests."

INDEED, Death agreed, rising from the bench with the sort of fluid grace that suggested he had never needed to worry about aging joints or the accumulated wear and tear of physical existence. He tucked the hourglass away in his robe with careful precision. THOUGH I SUSPECT TONIGHT WILL BE QUIETER THAN USUAL.

"Why's that?" Vimes asked, though he suspected he already knew the answer.

WORD HAS GOTTEN AROUND THAT DEATH HIMSELF IS PATROLLING THE STREETS. THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT APPEARS TO HAVE DEVELOPED A SUDDEN INTEREST IN LAW-ABIDING BEHAVIOR. IT IS REMARKABLE HOW QUICKLY PEOPLE CAN REASSESS THEIR LIFE PRIORITIES WHEN PRESENTED WITH APPROPRIATE INCENTIVES.

Vimes grinned. "Best arrest rate in the history of the Watch. I should put you in for a commendation."

I WOULD PREFER A SMALL RAISE. I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MORTAL EXISTENCE REQUIRES CURRENCY.

"Right. I'll talk to Vetinari about the budget. Though knowing him, he's probably already allocated funds for 'Supernatural Consultant Services.'"

As they walked through the quiet streets of Empirical Crescent and beyond, their footsteps echoing in comfortable rhythm on the well-maintained cobblestones, Vimes reflected that some of the best partnerships were the ones you never saw coming. The city around them seemed somehow more peaceful than usual, as if even the architecture had decided to behave itself for the evening. Street lamps burned with steady flames, shadows fell in predictable patterns, and the general atmosphere suggested that the universe had temporarily suspended its usual interest in cosmic irony.

Behind them, tucked safely away in Death's robe, the hourglass continued to glow with its gentle, persistent light. The smoke within swirled eternally in patterns that spoke of duty transcended, principles embodied, and the sort of stubborn determination that chose meaning over efficiency despite the best efforts of chaos, bureaucracy, and cosmic order. It was not a sign of cheating death, but rather a symbol of something that had transcended the normal boundaries between life and whatever came after—a recognition that some principles are worth preserving even when they defy cosmic efficiency.

It was, Vimes thought as they turned onto Broad Way and began their patrol of the city's quieter quarters, a pretty good arrangement all around. Some people got gold watches when they retired. Some got pensions or honors or recognition from their peers.

All things considered, he could live with that responsibility. Possibly forever.

*The End*

**Author's Note:** *In which we learn that sometimes the most unlikely connections are the ones that change everything. Death may be inevitable, but apparently, it's also capable of making exceptions for principles worth preserving, and understanding can transcend what bureaucracy would rationalize.*

*No cosmic constants were permanently harmed in the making of this story, though several had their feelings hurt, at least one filed a complaint with the union, and the universal filing system is now completely backed up with Philosophical Paradox Reports.*

[^rincewind]: It was usually Rincewind, though he had developed an impressive repertoire of excuses, ranging from the medically implausible ("I've got a severe allergy to things with teeth") to the philosophically complex ("I believe feeding carnivorous books violates their literary autonomy"). The books, for their part, had learned to recognize him and would try to look especially hungry when he approached, which didn't help his motivation.
[^sybil]: "Practical Metaphysics" for the daughters of the Ankh-Morpork aristocracy was less about debating the nature of reality and more about learning which supernatural entities one could safely invite to tea, the correct way to address a vampire with a gambling problem, and the proper fork to use when dining with a lich. It was considered a vital social skill.
[^oblong]: The Patrician's office was known as the Oblong Office. Its peculiar dimensions, which seemed to defy the known laws of architecture, were a constant source of debate among the city's intelligentsia. Some claimed it was a subtle application of L-space, while others suggested the architect had simply been very bad at math. The truth, as with most things concerning Lord Vetinari, was probably more complicated and considerably more unsettling. The effect, however, was undisputed: it was impossible to feel comfortable there, which was precisely the point.
[^auditors]: The Auditors of Reality hated life, not because it was evil, but because it was messy. Life had a terrible habit of being unpredictable, of creating interesting and unique things that didn't fit neatly into columns on a ledger. They dreamed of a universe that was perfectly ordered, silent, and gray. A universe where nothing ever happened, twice. Their one great weakness was that they had to obey the rules. All of them. Especially the boring ones.
