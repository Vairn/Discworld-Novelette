something of a following habit, the universe has a sense of humor that
would make the gods weep, and some people are dying who really shouldn’t
be—while others who should be dying aren’t.</em></p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.1" id="prologue"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Prologue</h3><p>Ankh-Morpork was, generally speaking, the sort of city where the
unexpected was less a possibility and more a scheduled municipal event,
often listed somewhere near ‘Guild of Seamstresses Annual Picnic’ on the
city calendar. Even so, some days managed to surprise everyone,
particularly those whose job involved maintaining order when the very
fabric of reality seemed to have mislaid its instructions.</p><p>The list arrived via the usual channels. Encrypted, of course,
delivered with the quiet efficiency that defined the operation. No
names, not in the conventional sense. Just designations. Targets.
Irregularities.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="4"><p>Each entry was a stain on the cosmic ledger, a deviation from the
scheduled flow of things. The killer’s purpose was simple: restore
order. Eliminate the anomalies. It wasn’t personal. Personal implied
emotion, and emotion was a variable that introduced unacceptable levels
of unpredictability.</p><p>The methodology was chosen for efficiency and discretion. No pattern
in the weapon or technique that a less… observant… authority might
easily discern. A garrote – quick, silent, and easily disposed of. A
swift thrust – a clean, professional termination that mimicked a violent
accident. Poison – subtle, delayed, appearing as a relapse of a previous
condition. Something direct – a knife, fitting for someone who dealt in
sharp truths.</p><p>The employers appreciated efficiency. They valued procedure above all
else. Life, in their view, was a process, a calculation, an entry in an
infinite series of accounts. Death was simply the final audit. These
individuals, by surviving their scheduled terminus, had introduced
errors into the system. They were like rogue data points, corrupting the
elegant simplicity of the universal algorithm.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="5"><p>The killer’s role was the garbage collector. The error correction
protocol. They weren’t driven by malice, or greed, or any of the messy,
irrational motivations that afflicted the majority of the sentient life
they encountered. They were driven by purpose. By the quiet, internal
satisfaction of restoring balance, of ensuring that the numbers added
up.</p><p>There was a certain aesthetic to it, a clean precision that appealed
to their nature. The world, left to its own chaotic devices, generated
endless entropy. Their work was the opposite – the imposition of
elegant, necessary finality.</p><p>The killer checked the time. The window for the next correction was
opening. Subject Designation: Cripley, M. His location was confirmed.
The method was prepared. Another anomaly to be erased. Another line item
to be closed. Another step towards restoring the beautiful,
uncomplicated order that the universe, in its sloppier moments, seemed
determined to resist.</p><p>It was just a job. The most important job in existence, perhaps, but
just a job all the same.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="6"><p>In the spaces between realities, entities that valued order above all
else made careful notes in ledgers that would never be audited. The
irregularities were being corrected, one by one. The system was being
restored to its proper parameters.</p><p>Soon, the beautiful silence of perfect order would return.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.2" id="chapter-1-the-uncomfortable-truth"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Chapter 1: The Uncomfortable
Truth</h3><p>The thing about murder scenes, Commander Sam Vimes reflected as he
stood in the squalid room where Sarah Palmley had died, was that they
had a way of making you ask uncomfortable questions about the nature of
justice, the value of human life, and why some people seemed to die so
bloody easily while others kept on breathing despite the universe’s
apparent best efforts.</p><p>The victim was Sarah Palmley, aged thirty-two, and she had died in
her one-room tenement while her newborn baby slept in a drawer that
served as a cot. The drawer was lined with old newspapers and what
appeared to be the woman’s only clean cloth.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="7"><p>What made this death particularly infuriating was not just that Sarah
had been strangled with her own shawl—a piece of clothing so threadbare
it was barely worthy of the name—but that she had been murdered sometime
after giving birth to a healthy daughter. Someone had killed a new
mother, which suggested either complete lack of conscience or something
darker that Vimes preferred not to think about.</p><p>Vimes examined the scene with the sort of methodical attention that
came from years of dealing with the aftermath of human cruelty. His gaze
swept the squalid room, honed by years of seeing the worst of human
cruelty. He settled first on the victim, then moved methodically—the
angle of the shawl, the lack of disturbance, the single candle stub,
carefully rationed.</p><p>The killer hadn’t lingered—this was quick, efficient work that spoke
of either professional skill or cold determination.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="8"><p>The room told the story of a life lived on society’s margins. A
single candle stub, carefully rationed. Clothes hanging on nails driven
into the wall, each piece mended multiple times with thread that didn’t
quite match. A tin cup that served as both drinking vessel and cooking
pot. The sort of poverty that wasn’t just the absence of money, but the
absence of hope that money would ever exist.</p><p>“She was working,” Vimes observed, noting the pile of piecework
sewing in the corner. “Trying to make enough to feed herself and the
baby.” He picked up one of the handkerchiefs she’d been sewing—fine
work, despite everything.</p><p>“Professional job,” he muttered, studying the evidence of deliberate,
methodical murder. “Someone who knew exactly what they were doing.” It
was the same unnerving efficiency he’d seen in the recent deaths of
Thomas Keel and Margaret Dowdy – clean, precise, and utterly devoid of
passion.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="9"><p>The baby stirred in her newspaper-lined drawer, making the sort of
small, helpless sounds that reminded you that some problems couldn’t be
solved with arrests or paperwork. The child was healthy, which was a
miracle given the circumstances, but health wouldn’t keep her fed or
housed or alive in a city that treated poverty like a moral failing.</p><p>“Right then,” he said to the empty room, but with the sort of grim
determination that had made him the Watch’s most effective Commander.
“We’re going to catch whoever killed Sarah Palmley. We’re going to
arrest them, and charge them, and make sure they spend a very long time
thinking about what they’ve done.”</p><p>As for the baby, Vimes reflected, Lady Sybil had been looking for a
cause to champion. He suspected she was about to become very interested
in affordable housing policy and the welfare of orphaned children.</p><p>Outside, the city continued its eternal business of being complicated
and morally ambiguous, but inside the squalid room where Sarah Palmley
had died, Commander Vimes was quietly planning to make someone’s day
considerably worse.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="10"><p>He was examining the shawl that had been used to strangle Sarah when
the temperature in the room dropped several degrees. Not the sort of
gradual cooling that came from an evening breeze, but the sudden,
profound cold that suggested someone had opened a door between this
world and somewhere considerably less hospitable.</p><p><span class="death-speech">COMMANDER VIMES.</span></p><p>Vimes didn’t turn around immediately. In his experience, dramatic
entrances worked better when you didn’t give them your full attention
right away. Instead, he continued studying the murder weapon, noting the
professional way it had been twisted.</p><p>“Death,” he said calmly. “I was wondering when you’d show up. Though
I have to say, you’re usually more punctual about these things.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I DID NOT COME FOR HER.</span></p><p>This made Vimes look up. Death stood in the doorway, his presence
somehow making the small room feel even more cramped and squalid. But
there was something unusual about his posture—an uncertainty that didn’t
fit with the normal confidence of an anthropomorphic personification
going about his business.</p><p>“You didn’t come for Sarah Palmley? She’s definitely dead.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I KNOW. BUT I WAS NOT… SUMMONED.</span></p><p>“Summoned?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="11"><p><span class="death-speech">WHEN SOMEONE DIES, I AM AWARE OF IT. I FEEL THE MOMENT OF TRANSITION.
THERE IS A… PULL… THAT DRAWS ME TO GUIDE THEIR PASSAGE.</span> Death examined
the scene with what might have been professional interest. <span class="death-speech">BUT WITH THIS
WOMAN, THERE WAS NO SUMMONS. SHE DIED, BUT SOMETHING PREVENTED THE
NORMAL PROCESS.</span></p><p>Vimes felt the familiar chill that came when a straightforward murder
case started involving supernatural complications. “What sort of
something?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I DO NOT KNOW. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE.</span> Death moved closer to examine
Sarah’s body with the sort of clinical attention that most people found
disturbing. <span class="death-speech">IN RECENT WEEKS, THERE HAVE BEEN… IRREGULARITIES. PEOPLE
DYING WHO SHOULD NOT YET DIE, WITHOUT THE PROPER… PROTOCOLS.</span></p><p>“Protocols?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THE NATURAL ORDER, COMMANDER. DEATH HAS PROCEDURES. SCHEDULES.</span> WHEN
SOMEONE’<span class="death-speech">S TIME COMES, I AM THERE TO GUIDE THE TRANSITION. BUT THESE
MURDERS… THEY ARE OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE PROPER CHANNELS.</span></p><p>Vimes studied Death with the sort of professional attention he
usually reserved for witnesses who might be lying or telling the truth
in ways that would make his life more complicated. “Are you telling me
that someone is committing murders that even Death didn’t see
coming?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="12"><p><span class="death-speech">PRECISELY. AND THAT, COMMANDER, IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING.</span></p><p>“Because?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS SOMEONE HAS THE POWER TO INTERFERE WITH DEATH
ITSELF. AND VERY FEW ENTITIES POSSESS SUCH AUTHORITY.</span></p><p>The baby stirred in her drawer, making small sounds that reminded
them both that some problems required immediate practical solutions
regardless of their cosmic implications.</p><p>“Right then,” Vimes said, settling his thoughts into the sort of grim
focus that had served him through decades of complicated cases. “Looks
like we have a partner investigation. You handle the supernatural
irregularities, I’ll handle the criminal evidence. Between us, we might
actually solve this thing.”</p><p>I WOULD APPRECIATE THE ASSISTANCE, Death admitted. <span class="death-speech">I FIND MYSELF…
UNCERTAIN… ABOUT THE PROPER PROCEDURES FOR INVESTIGATING MY OWN
PROFESSIONAL DISRUPTION.</span></p><p>“Don’t worry about that,” Vimes said, lighting a cigar. “I’ve been
investigating impossible things for years. The trick is to treat them
like regular crimes until they prove otherwise.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="13"><p>It was, he reflected, the kind of case that reminded him why he wore
the badge: a mystery, a wrong to set right, and just enough strangeness
to keep him sharp. Even if the boundaries of his job were getting
stranger by the day.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.3" id="chapter-2-the-pattern"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Chapter 2: The Pattern</h3><p>The fourth murder scene was as baffling as the first three, with the
added twist that Death was now examining evidence with a professional
curiosity that suggested he was either learning new investigative
techniques or developing worrying hobbies.</p><p>Commander Sam Vimes stood over the body of Marcus Cripley, a private
investigator who made his living from other people’s secrets—honest
work, in its way, though it tended to create a remarkably diverse
collection of individuals who might have strong opinions about your
continued existence.</p><p>“Same killer,” Vimes said, not needing confirmation but appreciating
professional consensus. “Same technique, same efficiency, same complete
lack of passion.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="14"><p>SAME ABSENCE OF PROPER PROTOCOLS, Death added, crouching beside the
body with the sort of skeletal grace that came from never having to
worry about joint pain. <span class="death-speech">I WAS NOT SUMMONED FOR THIS ONE EITHER.</span></p><p>“So someone’s murdering people in a way that bypasses Death himself,”
Vimes mused, lighting a cigar. “That’s either very impressive or very
stupid, depending on your perspective.”</p><p>Captain Carrot arrived with his usual punctual efficiency, followed
by Sergeant Angua, who immediately began examining the crime scene with
the sort of focused attention that came from having senses considerably
more acute than those possessed by normal humans.</p><p>“Commander,” Carrot said, then stopped and stared at Death with the
expression of someone whose training had covered many unusual situations
but not specifically this one. “Ah. Death. Good morning.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">GOOD MORNING, CAPTAIN CARROT. I AM ASSISTING WITH THE
INVESTIGATION.</span></p><p>“Right. Of course.” Carrot consulted his notebook with the sort of
professional adaptability that had made him the Watch’s most reliable
officer. “What do we know about the connection between the victims?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="15"><p>“They all survived things that should have killed them,” Vimes said.
“Sarah Palmley survived a difficult childbirth. Thomas Keel walked away
from a carriage accident. Margaret Dowdy recovered from consumption. And
Marcus here was investigating insurance fraud cases involving people
who’d had similar experiences.”</p><p>“People who nearly died but didn’t,” Angua added, her nose twitching
as she followed a scent trail around the room. “Someone’s tracking
people who’ve cheated death, then killing them.”</p><p>THEY DID NOT CHEAT DEATH, Death said with the sort of precision that
suggested professional standards were at stake. <span class="death-speech">THEY SURVIVED ACCORDING
TO THE NATURAL ORDER. THEIR TIME HAD NOT YET COME.</span> Death examined the
murder weapon with interest. <span class="death-speech">BUT SOMEONE IS ELIMINATING THEM BEFORE
THEIR PROPER TIME, WHICH CREATES… IRREGULARITIES.</span></p><p>“What sort of irregularities?” Carrot asked.</p><p><span class="death-speech">COSMIC ONES. WHEN SOMEONE DIES OUTSIDE THE PROPER SCHEDULE, IT
AFFECTS THE BALANCE OF THINGS. REALITY BECOMES… LESS STABLE.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="16"><p>Angua paused in her scent tracking. “Commander, there’s something
else. The same chemical signature from the other crime scenes, but
stronger. And there’s something…” she concentrated, “…something that
smells like paperwork. Bureaucracy. The sort of administrative smell you
get in government offices.”</p><p>“Paperwork?” Vimes asked.</p><p>“Rubber stamps, filing cabinets, that particular blend of ink and
disappointment that suggests forms being filled out in triplicate.”</p><p>Death appeared thoughtful. <span class="death-speech">THERE ARE ENTITIES THAT TREAT EXISTENCE AS
AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEM.</span></p><p>“What kind of entities?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THE KIND THAT VALUE ORDER ABOVE LIFE, EFFICIENCY ABOVE COMPASSION.
THE KIND THAT WOULD CONSIDER UNAUTHORIZED SURVIVAL TO BE A FILING ERROR
REQUIRING CORRECTION.</span></p><p>Vimes felt the familiar chill that came when a case shifted from
merely complicated to potentially catastrophic. “Are you telling me that
cosmic bureaucrats are hiring assassins to kill people for not dying on
schedule?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THAT WOULD BE… CONSISTENT WITH RECENT EVENTS.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="17"><p>“Right then,” Vimes said, settling into the sort of grim
determination that had served him through decades of complicated cases.
“Carrot, I want you to start compiling information about all four
victims. Look for who might have access to their medical records,
accident reports, anything that would tell someone about their
near-death experiences. Angua, follow that bureaucratic scent. See where
it leads.”</p><p>“What about you, Commander?” Carrot asked.</p><p>“Death and I are going to have a conversation about cosmic entities
who think murder is a quality control measure. And then we’re going to
arrest them.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I BELIEVE THAT MAY BE MORE COMPLICATED THAN USUAL POLICE PROCEDURES,
D</span>eath observed.</p><p>“Probably,” Vimes agreed. “But the principle’s the same. Someone’s
committing murder in my city, which makes it my problem. The fact that
they’re doing it for cosmic reasons just means we’ll need different
paperwork.”</p><p>Some days, he reflected, being a policeman in Ankh-Morpork required
considerable flexibility in one’s definition of jurisdiction.</p><hr/></div><div class="page" data-page="18"><h3 data-number="1.1.4" id="chapter-3-the-investigation"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Chapter 3: The
Investigation</h3><p>Vimes gathered his officers in the main office of the Watch House,
which had been cleared of wedding planning materials and returned to its
more familiar state of organized chaos. Death sat in one of the
visitor’s chairs with the sort of stillness that suggested he was either
deep in thought or had temporarily forgotten how to exist. Captain
Carrot had prepared a detailed summary of the case with the sort of
methodical thoroughness that made hardened criminals confess to things
they hadn’t even thought of doing yet, while Sergeant Colon had
contributed a pot of coffee strong enough to wake the dead and possibly
offer them employment opportunities.</p><p>The presence of Death had created what Vimes privately thought of as
“an interesting dynamic” among his officers. Cheery kept glancing at him
with the sort of professional curiosity that suggested she was wondering
about the forensic applications of skeletal anatomy. Nobby seemed
disappointed that Death wasn’t wearing a more dramatic costume. And
Sergeant Colon kept offering him tea, apparently under the impression
that Death might be cold.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="19"><p>“Right then,” Vimes said, studying the evidence board that Cheery had
constructed with military precision. “Four murders in four days. All
people who survived things that should have killed them. Someone’s
cleaning house, and we’re going to find out who.”</p><p>The evidence board was a masterpiece of investigative organization.
Photographs of the victims were arranged in chronological order,
connected by red string to locations, potential motives, and known
associates. Maps showed the locations of each murder, marked with
different colored pins that indicated time of death, method of killing,
and proximity to various civic institutions. The overall effect was less
“police investigation” and more “military campaign planning,” which was
probably appropriate given the systematic nature of the crimes.</p><p>“What do we know about the killer?” Vimes asked.</p><p>“Professional,” Angua said immediately. “Clean kills, no unnecessary
violence, no sexual motivation. This is someone who treats murder like a
job.”</p><p>“Someone with access to information about people’s near-death
experiences,” Carrot added. “They knew exactly who had survived things
that should have killed them.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="20"><p>“And someone with resources,” Cheery contributed. “The weapons were
different each time - knife, poison, garrote, blunt instrument. Either
they have a large collection, or they can acquire whatever they need for
each specific job.”</p><p>SOMEONE WHO OPERATES OUTSIDE THE NORMAL CHANNELS OF MORTALITY, Death
added. <span class="death-speech">THE MURDERS CREATE NO RIPPLES IN THE COSMIC ORDER, NO DISTURBANCE
IN THE NATURAL FLOW OF THINGS. WHICH SUGGESTS THEY ARE BEING CONDUCTED
BY ENTITIES THAT UNDERSTAND HOW TO… CIRCUMVENT… NORMAL PROCESSES.</span></p><p>Nobby raised his hand. “Also, someone who doesn’t like weddings very
much.”</p><p>“Why do you say that, Nobby?” Vimes asked, though he suspected he was
going to regret the question.</p><p>“Well, three of the four victims were connected to wedding
celebrations. Sarah Palmley was killed right after having a baby -
that’s like a wedding for babies, isn’t it? And Thomas Keel was meant to
die on his way to his nephew’s ceremony. And Marcus Cripley was
investigating insurance fraud at wedding venues.”</p><p>There was a pause while everyone considered this. It was, Vimes
reflected, either completely stupid or remarkably insightful. With
Nobby, the distinction was often less clear than one might expect.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="21"><p>“Actually,” Carrot said slowly, “that’s not entirely unreasonable. If
someone’s targeting people Death saved during happy occasions…”</p><p>“Then they might have something against happiness in general,” Angua
finished. “Or against things that disrupt their idea of proper
order.”</p><p>“Right then. Nobby, Colon - I want you to canvas the neighborhoods
where the victims lived. Talk to people, find out if anyone saw anything
unusual. Be polite. Be official. Be the sort of polite and official that
makes people want to help.”</p><p>“Can I wear my dress?” Nobby asked hopefully.</p><p>“No dresses, Nobby.”</p><p>“What about a nice suit?”</p><p>“You can wear your dress uniform and look respectable for once in
your career.”</p><p>“Carrot, Angua - I want you to visit the places where these people
had their near-death experiences. The hospital where Sarah gave birth,
the street where Thomas had his accident. See if anything connects
them.”</p><p>“And me, Commander?” Cheery asked.</p><p>“You’re going to do what you do best, Cheery. Go through the forensic
evidence and tell me things I haven’t thought to ask about.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="22"><p>As his officers dispersed to their various tasks, Vimes felt a grim
satisfaction settle in his gut. Suspects, motives, evidence. No cosmic
entities, no bloody philosophy.</p><p>It was, he thought, almost relaxing.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.5" id="chapter-4-the-evidence"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.5</span> Chapter 4: The Evidence</h3><p>Cheery Littlebottom sat in the Watch House basement surrounded by the
sort of scientific equipment that would have impressed the Faculty of
Practical Magic at Unseen University, if the wizards had been capable of
thinking about anything more practical than whose turn it was to feed
the Library’s more carnivorous books. The basement served as both
forensic laboratory and general storage area for things that were too
dangerous to keep upstairs but too valuable to throw away, which created
an interesting working environment that combined cutting-edge
investigative techniques with the constant possibility of accidental
poisoning.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="23"><p>The walls were lined with shelves containing evidence from hundreds
of cases: bottled samples of suspicious substances, preserved
fingerprints, weapons that had been catalogued and stored for future
reference, and an impressive collection of what Cheery professionally
referred to as “interesting stains.” Gas lamps provided steady
illumination, supplemented by the sort of specialized lighting equipment
that allowed for detailed examination of evidence that preferred not to
be examined in detail.</p><p>Cheery looked up from her evidence with the sort of expression that
suggested she’d found something both disturbing and illuminating.</p><p>“Right,” she said without preamble. “Our killer’s been making
mistakes. Expensive mistakes.”</p><p>The laboratory door opened and Captain Carrot descended the stairs,
followed by Sergeant Angua, both of them carrying the sort of
expressions that suggested their afternoon had been educational in ways
they hadn’t entirely expected.</p><p>“Any luck with the wedding venues?” Cheery asked.</p><p>“Our victims all had near-death experiences at the same locations,”
Carrot said. “And Marcus Cripley was investigating insurance fraud
involving people who nearly died but recovered unexpectedly.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="24"><p>“The kind where people take out life insurance policies, then stage
accidents,” Angua added. “Except our victims weren’t part of any fraud.
They just survived when they shouldn’t have.”</p><p>“That explains the silk fibers,” Cheery said, producing a vial.
“Expensive silk, contaminated with preservation chemicals and something
else—insurance documentation ink. Our killer works in the insurance
industry and has access to professional preservation equipment.”</p><p>Angua’s nose twitched. “That would explain the strange scent I
detected at the crime scene. Something chemical, but not quite
human.”</p><p>“Exactly. Our killer has access to unusual preservatives, which
narrows our suspect list considerably.”</p><p>The laboratory door opened again, and Sergeant Colon descended the
stairs with Nobby Nobbs trailing behind, both of them looking slightly
confused.</p><p>“Afternoon, all,” Colon said. “We’ve been canvassing the
neighborhoods like you asked, Commander.”</p><p>“Find anything interesting?” Angua asked.</p><p>“Well,” Nobby consulted his notebook, “people keep mentioning strange
smells around the time of the murders. Chemical smells. And someone in a
professional-looking outfit who didn’t seem quite… right.”</p><p>“Not quite right how?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="25"><p>“Hard to say. Just… too formal. Too neat. Like someone playing a role
rather than actually being what they appeared to be.”</p><p>Cheery nodded. “That fits with what we’ve found here. Our killer is
definitely a professional - someone who treats murder like a technical
problem to be solved.”</p><p>“Any evidence pointing to specific individuals?”</p><p>“Actually, yes.” Cheery produced a small glass vial containing what
appeared to be ordinary dust. “This is residue from the murder weapon
used to kill Thomas Keel. It contains traces of a very specific type of
preservative that’s quite rare.”</p><p>“What kind of preservative?”</p><p>“The kind used by… collectors. People who preserve things that are
meant to last indefinitely.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence as everyone considered the
implications.</p><p>“So,” Carrot said slowly, “we have a killer who uses
professional-grade preservation chemicals, works with methodical
precision, and specifically targets people who’ve cheated death.”</p><p>“Someone who considers survival to be an error that needs
correcting,” Angua added.</p><p>“Right then,” Colon said. “I think we need to talk to the Commander
about this. This is getting into territory that’s above our pay
grade.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="26"><p>As they prepared to leave the laboratory, Cheery reflected that there
was something deeply satisfying about good forensic work. No
supernatural intervention required, no cosmic entities needed - just
careful observation, scientific method, and the sort of attention to
detail that criminals always underestimated.</p><p>It was, she thought, proper police work at its finest.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.6" id="chapter-5-quality-control"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6</span> Chapter 5: Quality
Control</h3><p>The methodical review of completed assignments was a necessity that
distinguished professional work from amateur enthusiasm. Each case file
was examined with the sort of careful attention that might have
impressed the Guild of Accountants, if members of that organization had
been capable of contemplating activities more hazardous than tax
assessment.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="27"><p>The workspace was precise, organized according to principles that
valued efficiency above comfort. Maps of the city covered one wall,
marked with pins of various colors indicating locations of interest,
timing considerations, and potential complications. A second wall
displayed what might have been called a organizational chart, though the
relationships it depicted were unlikely to be found in any conventional
business manual.</p><p>The killer sat at a desk that might have belonged to any middle-level
bureaucrat—solid wood, clean lines, everything in its proper place. The
only unusual feature was the locked cabinet that contained specialized
equipment arranged with the sort of care typically reserved for surgical
instruments or particularly valuable wines.</p><p><em>Assignment Review: S. Palmley</em> <em>Method: Strangulation

<em>Cleanup Requirements: Standard protocols</em></p></div><div class="page" data-page="28"><p>The killer made notes in a precise hand, documenting details that
would be of interest to certain parties who valued thoroughness in their
service providers. The work was evaluated not for emotional
satisfaction—emotion being a variable that introduced unacceptable
unpredictability—but for technical excellence and adherence to
specifications.</p><p><em>Assignment Review: T. Keel</em> <em>Method: Blade work, precision

adapting standardized procedures to specific circumstances while
maintaining the sort of professional standards that their employers had
come to expect. It was skilled work, requiring not just technical
competence but an understanding of larger operational objectives.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="29"><p>The next assignment required consideration. Subject Designation:
Cripley, M. Private investigator, recently involved in insurance fraud
investigations. The irony was not lost on the killer—someone who made
their living from discovering other people’s secrets was about to
discover that some secrets were more dangerous than others.</p><p>The preliminary surveillance had been completed. Cripley maintained
regular hours, lived alone, and had the sort of casual approach to
personal security that suggested he had never seriously considered that
someone might want him dead. This was common among people who dealt in
information rather than violence. They understood blackmail and bribery,
but they rarely prepared for more direct solutions to the problems they
created.</p><p>A soft chime indicated an incoming communication. The killer
activated the mechanism with the sort of practiced efficiency that
suggested regular use.</p><p><em>New parameters confirmed. Continue current operational timeline.

Incident</h3><p>Commander Vimes sat in Harga’s House of Ribs, which occupied a
special place in Ankh-Morpork’s culinary ecosystem somewhere between
“restaurant” and “biological warfare facility.” The establishment had
earned its reputation through a combination of aggressive pricing,
mysterious ingredients, and the sort of robust approach to food safety
that assumed anyone weak enough to be poisoned by breakfast probably
wasn’t cut out for life in the big city anyway.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="32"><p>The House of Ribs was located in a narrow building that leaned
against its neighbors for support, much like its clientele. The windows
were yellow with grease and decades of accumulated cooking smoke, which
filtered the morning light into a golden haze that made everything look
slightly more appetizing than it actually was. This was probably
intentional. The air inside was thick enough to chew, heavy with the
scents of frying meat, burnt coffee, and something that might have been
bacon if bacon could be weaponized.</p><p>Vimes sat in his usual booth—scarred wood that had witnessed more
confessions than most priest holes—reading his copy of the Ankh-Morpork
Times while working his way through what Harga optimistically advertised
as a “Full Breakfast.” The meal consisted of items that had once, in
their natural state, probably resembled food. The eggs had clearly led
interesting lives before arriving on his plate, the bacon exhibited a
structural integrity that suggested it could be used for light
construction work, and the sausages had achieved a color not normally
found in nature outside of certain tropical warning systems.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="33"><p>Vimes liked Harga’s because it was honest about what it was—a place
where you could get breakfast that would either kill you or make you
strong enough to survive whatever the day had planned for you. Either
way, you knew where you stood, which was more than could be said for
most of Ankh-Morpork’s civic institutions.</p><p>He was contemplating an object that Harga claimed was a grilled
tomato but which bore a suspicious resemblance to something that might
explode under pressure, when the morning light seemed to dim slightly.
This wasn’t unusual in Ankh-Morpork, where the light was regularly
dimmed by everything from industrial smoke to localized weather
phenomena to the occasional dragon, but this particular dimming had a
quality that suggested metaphysical rather than meteorological
causes.</p><p>A familiar figure settled into the booth across from him with the
sort of fluid motion that belonged to someone who didn’t need to worry
about the normal constraints of anatomy.</p><p><span class="death-speech">GOOD MORNING, COMMANDER.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="34"><p>“Death.” Vimes didn’t look up from his newspaper, which was running
its usual mixture of political scandal, unexplained disappearances, and
a surprisingly optimistic piece about a local merchant’s plan to
introduce “customer service” to Ankh-Morpork retail. The last item was
filed under “Lifestyle” rather than “Comedy,” which showed either
remarkable editorial restraint or a complete lack of understanding about
local economic conditions. “Bit early for you, isn’t it? Don’t you
usually work the night shift, like burglars and other
professionals?”</p><p>Death considered this question with the sort of careful attention
most people reserved for mathematical theorems or their tax returns. <span class="death-speech">I
WORK ALL HOURS, ACTUALLY.</span> DEATH DOESN’<span class="death-speech">T KEEP REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS. THE
UNIVERSE OPERATES ON A TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR SCHEDULE, BUT MORTALITY TENDS TO
BE MORE… OPPORTUNISTIC.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="35"><p>“Right. Well, if you’re here for Harga, you might want to wait.
Pretty sure his cooking is going to finish the job eventually. Save you
the trip.” Vimes gestured at his plate with his fork, which had acquired
a slight bend from wrestling with the bacon. “Though I suppose that
would be death by natural causes. Or possibly death by unnatural causes,
depending on what he’s using for preservatives.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I AM NOT HERE ON BUSINESS.</span></p><p>This time Vimes did look up from his newspaper. Death was sitting
perfectly still, skeletal hands folded on the table with the sort of
precision that suggested either meditation or rigor mortis. His eye
sockets seemed fixed intently on Vimes.</p><p>The sight was somewhat unnerving, partly because Death wasn’t usually
someone who waited for things. In the normal course of events, things
waited for Death—usually while trying to run away, bargain for more
time, or complete their tax returns. The idea of Death as a customer
rather than a service provider suggested either a fundamental shift in
the cosmic order or possibly just a very slow morning in the mortality
business.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="36"><p>“Social call again?” Vimes asked, spearing something that might have
been an egg, though it exhibited a suspicious resilience that suggested
it had been fortified with materials not normally associated with
poultry. “This is getting to be a habit.”</p><p>HABITS ARE INTERESTING THINGS, Death observed with the sort of
philosophical air that suggested he’d been giving the matter
considerable thought. <span class="death-speech">THEY PROVIDE STRUCTURE TO EXISTENCE. THEY CREATE
PREDICTABILITY IN AN UNPREDICTABLE UNIVERSE. THEY ALLOW MORTALS TO
FUNCTION WITHOUT HAVING TO CONSCIOUSLY DECIDE WHETHER TO CONTINUE
BREATHING EVERY FEW SECONDS.</span></p><p>“That’s true,” Vimes agreed, though he suspected Death’s
understanding of habits might be slightly different from the average
person’s. “My habit is trying to keep this city from falling apart
completely. What’s yours?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">DEATH IS NOT A HABIT. IT IS MORE OF A… CALLING. THOUGH I SUPPOSE ONE
COULD ARGUE THAT ETERNAL EXISTENCE CREATES ITS OWN PATTERNS. THERE IS A
CERTAIN RHYTHM TO MORTALITY THAT BECOMES… FAMILIAR.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="37"><p>“Right.” Vimes chewed thoughtfully, noting that the mysterious
breakfast item had the texture of something that could probably survive
a small explosion. “So what brings you to breakfast? And please tell me
you’re not here to discuss my cholesterol levels. Lady Sybil already
covers that topic thoroughly, with charts.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR DAILY ROUTINE.</span></p><p>“My routine?” Vimes raised an eyebrow, causing a small crease to
appear in his forehead that had been worn there by years of dealing with
municipal bureaucracy and criminal creativity. “It’s not that
interesting. Get up, try to prevent the city from burning down, go home,
repeat. Occasionally there are riots, but those are usually scheduled in
advance by the Guild of Rioters. Very professional organization,
actually. They file proper paperwork and everything.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">BUT YOU APPROACH EACH DAY AS IF IT MATTERS.</span></p><p>The observation hung in the air between them like incense, heavy with
implications that neither of them was quite ready to examine too
closely.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="38"><p>“Well, yes. Because it does. Every day matters. That’s the point.”
Vimes looked up from his breakfast, meeting Death’s gaze directly in the
way that most people found difficult and many found impossible. “If you
don’t act like today matters, you end up with a tomorrow that’s worse
than yesterday. Simple mathematics, really.”</p><p>Death appeared to be thinking about this, which was somewhat
unnerving. Death thinking was like watching someone juggle live
grenades—fascinating in an intellectual sense, but suggesting the
possibility of consequences that extended well beyond the immediate
vicinity.</p><p><span class="death-speech">MOST PEOPLE SPEND THEIR LIVES PREPARING TO LIVE, D</span>eath observed, in
the tone of someone who had been making notes.</p><p>“Most people are idiots,” Vimes said cheerfully, attacking what
appeared to be a sausage but might have been a small cylindrical
building material. “Present company excepted, of course.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">OF COURSE.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="39"><p>There was a comfortable silence, broken only by the sounds of other
customers bravely tackling Harga’s interpretation of morning nutrition.
The restaurant’s usual clientele consisted primarily of people whose
relationship with food was based more on necessity than pleasure:
night-shift workers heading home, day-shift workers summoning courage
for the hours ahead, and the occasional tourist who had mistaken
adventurous eating for actual adventure and was now learning the
difference.</p><p>Vimes finished his breakfast with the sort of methodical
determination that suggested either genuine hunger or a commitment to
getting his money’s worth. He stood to leave, noting that Death remained
seated with the stillness of someone who either had nowhere else to be
or was contemplating questions that didn’t have easy answers.</p><p>“Well, this has been… educational. But I’ve got a city to police.”
Vimes folded his newspaper under his arm, the morning’s headlines
already becoming yesterday’s problems. “Crime doesn’t take breakfast
breaks, unfortunately. More’s the pity.”</p><p>Death nodded with what might have been understanding. <span class="death-speech">UNTIL NEXT
TIME, COMMANDER.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="40"><p>“Next time?” But Death was already gone, leaving behind only the
faint scent of desert winds and old libraries, and the nagging feeling
that Vimes was missing something important. The spot where Death had
been sitting showed no sign of recent occupation except for a slight
coolness in the air and the distinct impression that something
fundamental had shifted in the cosmic order.</p><p>Vimes paid Harga—who accepted the money with the sort of professional
gratitude that suggested he understood the courage required to eat his
cooking—and left a tip that was more superstition than service. In
Ankh-Morpork, it was generally considered wise to stay on the good side
of anyone who handled your food, especially if their definition of
“food” was somewhat broader than most people’s.</p><p>He headed toward the Watch House, unconsciously falling into the
measured pace that had carried him through decades of police work.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.8" id="chapter-7-the-patrol"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.8</span> Chapter 7: The Patrol</h3></div><div class="page" data-page="41"><p>Vimes was on his rounds through the Shades, which was Ankh-Morpork’s
most honest neighborhood in the sense that everyone there was a criminal
and didn’t pretend otherwise. It was refreshing, in a way that could
only be appreciated by someone who spent most of his working life
dealing with people who stole money and called it taxation, or who
murdered people and called it politics.</p><p>The Shades occupied a special place in Ankh-Morpork’s geography—not
just physical, but moral and philosophical as well. It was the sort of
area that maps marked with the notation “Here Be Monsters,” except that
the monsters were generally more reasonable than the residents. The
buildings leaned against each other for support, much like their
inhabitants, and the streets followed the sort of logic that suggested
they had been laid out by someone who had never heard of straight lines
and considered them a dangerous foreign innovation.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="42"><p>During the day, the Shades maintained a certain shabby dignity, like
a retired general who had seen better times but still insisted on
wearing his medals. At night, however, it transformed into something
altogether more primal. The darkness here was not just the absence of
light but the presence of something else entirely—a quality of shadow
that seemed to have weight and intention. It was the sort of darkness
that made even experienced criminals check over their shoulders and walk
a little faster.</p><p>Vimes, being neither sensible nor foolish but something else
entirely—professional, perhaps, or possibly just too stubborn to admit
that anything could frighten him after thirty years of police
work—walked through these streets with the confidence of a man who had
seen worse things than dark alleys filled with cutthroats. This was
partly because he had, in fact, seen worse things, and partly because
his reputation preceded him in ways that made most criminals decide they
had urgent business elsewhere.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="43"><p>He had just finished explaining to a would-be mugger why attempting
to rob the Commander of the City Watch was both a career-limiting move
and a fundamental misunderstanding of the local power structure, when
Death appeared at his elbow with the sort of casual materialization that
suggested either considerable magical ability or a complete disregard
for the normal laws of physics.</p><p><span class="death-speech">GOOD EVENING, COMMANDER. INTERESTING TECHNIQUE.</span></p><p>“Death.” Vimes straightened his armor and continued walking, his
boots echoing off the damp cobblestones with the sort of measured rhythm
that had become as familiar to the Shades’ residents as the city’s
bells. Death walked beside him, his gaze steady.</p><p><span class="death-speech">I AM NOT CONCERNED WITH GOSSIP.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="44"><p>“No, I suppose you wouldn’t be. Hard to damage the reputation of the
inevitable.” Vimes turned down Scandal Alley, which had earned its name
through a combination of historical incidents and the sort of ongoing
activities that made it unsuitable for family entertainment. He noted
with professional interest that someone had improved the
lighting—probably the local Thieves’ Guild chapter, since good
visibility was essential for quality muggings. Poor lighting led to
embarrassing mistakes, such as attempting to rob people who were both
armed and professional about violence.</p><p><span class="death-speech">YOU SEEM REMARKABLY CALM ABOUT MY PRESENCE.</span></p><p>“Should I be worried? Are you here in a professional capacity this
time?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">NOT… EXACTLY.</span></p><p>“That’s reassuring. Sort of.” Vimes paused to help an elderly woman
who had been relieved of her purse by a young entrepreneur. The purse
was returned with a lecture on the economics of crime that left the
thief looking confused and oddly educated.</p><p><span class="death-speech">I AM IMPRESSED BY YOUR… METHODOLOGY, D</span>eath observed as they continued
their patrol.</p><p>“What methodology? I just do the job.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="45"><p><span class="death-speech">EXACTLY.</span> Death seemed pleased by this response, which was somehow
more disturbing than if he had seemed displeased.</p><p>They walked in companionable silence through the twisted streets,
which seemed to rearrange themselves slightly when no one was looking—a
common phenomenon in this part of the city, where the architecture had
developed a certain creative independence over the centuries. Death’s
presence had an oddly calming effect on the local criminal element,
though not in the way one might expect. Rather than fleeing in terror,
the various practitioners of unofficial economics seemed to take his
appearance as a sign that they should perhaps consider taking up safer
professions. Burglars decided to call it an early night and spend
quality time with their families. Pickpockets found themselves suddenly
interested in honest work, or at least work that didn’t involve personal
contact with potential victims. Even the gargoyles looked nervous, which
was remarkable given that they were generally considered to be among the
city’s more stoic residents.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="46"><p>“You know,” Vimes said as they emerged onto Broad Way, which was
broader than most streets in the Shades but still considerably narrower
than its name suggested, “this is either the most surreal evening of my
career, or I’m having some sort of breakdown. Either way, it’s been
educational.” He paused to light a cigar, noting that the flame seemed
steadier in Death’s presence, as if even fire recognized something
fundamental about his companion.</p><p>They paused outside a well-lit mansion where the sounds of a
well-bred social gathering drifted through the windows like music played
on instruments made of good breeding and old money. The contrast between
the refined merriment inside and the gritty reality of the Shades
outside was so stark it was almost philosophical.</p><p><span class="death-speech">I ASSUME THAT IS YOUR HOME?</span></p><p>“God, no. That’s the Rust place. I live over there.” Vimes pointed to
a more modest but well-maintained building. “Lady Sybil will be
wondering where I am. She’s probably got Willikins watching for me with
the good telescope.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">WILLIKINS?</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="47"><p>“The butler. Used to be quite handy with a knife, back in the day.
Now he’s handy with afternoon tea and tactical domestic management.
Amazing what a good butler can do with a silver service and a properly
threatening manner.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I HAVE MET FEW BUTLERS IN MY LINE OF WORK.</span></p><p>“That’s because Willikins doesn’t let people die in his house. Bad
for the silverware, apparently. Says it’s unprofessional.”</p><p>I FIND YOUR COMPANY… AGREEABLE, Death admitted. <span class="death-speech">YOU HAVE AN
INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE ON MORTALITY.</span></p><p>“Well, you seem like a reasonable sort of anthropomorphic
personification. Professional, too. I respect that. Besides, if I
worried about every supernatural entity that wandered through my life,
I’d never get any sleep. Last week Lord Vetinari sent me a note asking
about my health. I wasn’t ill.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THE PATRICIAN HAS HIS OWN RELATIONSHIP WITH INEVITABILITY.</span></p><p>“Don’t they all.” Vimes checked his watch. “Speaking of
inevitability, I should get home before Lady Sybil sends out a search
party. She’s got contacts in the Assassins’ Guild, and they’re very
thorough.”</p><p>Death appeared gratified by this assessment.</p><p><span class="death-speech">UNTIL TOMORROW, COMMANDER.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="48"><p>“Tomorrow?” But Death was gone again, leaving Vimes alone with the
growing certainty that something very strange was happening, and that he
was probably the last person in the city to figure out what it was.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.9" id="chapter-8-the-visitor"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.9</span> Chapter 8: The Visitor</h3><p>The appointment was kept precisely at midnight, as all the best
appointments were. Midnight had the advantage of being the sort of time
when sensible people were asleep, which left the night free for those
whose business required privacy, discretion, and the absence of
witnesses.</p><p>The meeting place was unremarkable—a small office above a respectable
import business that dealt in spices, silk, and the occasional item that
customs officials preferred not to examine too closely. The sort of
establishment that had been in business for generations and had
developed a reputation for asking very few questions about the nature of
its transactions.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="49"><p>The office itself was furnished in the style of someone who
understood that true luxury lay not in ostentation but in quality. The
desk was solid oak, the chairs were upholstered in leather that had been
properly cared for, and the filing cabinets were made of the sort of
steel that suggested their contents were worth protecting. It was the
office of someone who dealt in matters of importance, though what those
matters might be was not immediately apparent from the décor.</p><p>The figure behind the desk made notes in a ledger with the sort of
precise handwriting that suggested both excellent education and
considerable attention to detail. The entries were made in a code that
would have been meaningless to most observers, though certain members of
various professional guilds might have found them quite informative.</p><p><em>S. Palmley - Contract completed as specified. Payment rendered.
Client satisfaction confirmed.</em></p><p><em>T. Keel - Delayed execution resolved. Natural terminus restored.
Billing pending review.</em></p><p><em>M. Dowdy - Irregularity corrected. Documentation filed. Awaiting
further instructions.</em></p></div><div class="page" data-page="50"><p>A soft knock at the door interrupted this administrative work. The
figure looked up, checked a pocket watch, and nodded with satisfaction.
Promptness was a virtue too often neglected in modern business
relationships.</p><p>“Enter.”</p><p>The visitor who stepped through the door was the sort of person who
might have been anyone, which was precisely the point. Average height,
unremarkable features, the kind of face that blended seamlessly into
crowds and was forgotten as soon as the observer looked away. They wore
the sort of clothes that suggested middle-class respectability without
drawing attention to themselves—a skill that required considerable
practice to master.</p><p>“The arrangements are proceeding as discussed,” the visitor reported,
settling into the chair across from the desk. “Though there have been…
complications.”</p><p>“Complications are to be expected when dealing with cosmic
irregularities. Please elaborate.”</p><p>“The subject has begun forming personal attachments. This was not
anticipated in the original parameters.”</p><p>The figure behind the desk made a note in the margin of the ledger.
“Attachments to whom?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="51"><p>“Various residents of the city. The Watch Commander appears to be of
particular interest. There have been several documented interactions
that suggest something approaching… friendship.”</p><p>This information was received with the sort of calm attention that
suggested it was both surprising and important. “I see. And the impact
on our operational timeline?”</p><p>“Minimal, thus far. The primary objectives remain achievable.
However, these attachments may complicate the final resolution of the
situation.”</p><p>“In what way?”</p><p>“Sentiment has historically proven to be a significant factor in
decision-making processes. If the subject has developed emotional
investments in the outcome, rational calculation becomes
unreliable.”</p><p>The figure nodded thoughtfully. “This was always a possibility. We
have contingency plans for various forms of interference. Are you
prepared to implement them if necessary?”</p><p>“Of course. Though I should note that certain aspects of the
situation may require… creative solutions.”</p><p>“Creativity is why we selected you for this assignment. Your
reputation for innovative problem-solving preceded you.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="52"><p>The visitor acknowledged this compliment with a slight inclination of
the head. “When do you anticipate moving to the final phase?”</p><p>“Soon. The current disruptions cannot be allowed to continue
indefinitely. There are… other parties… who have begun to take notice.
Questions are being asked that would be better left unasked.”</p><p>“And if those questions lead to answers?”</p><p>“Then we will ensure that the individuals asking them are no longer
in a position to share their discoveries.” The figure closed the ledger
and locked it in a drawer of the desk. “Your services have been most
satisfactory thus far. I trust they will continue to be so.”</p><p>The visitor stood, understanding that the meeting was concluded. “Of
course. Though I should mention—there may be additional expenses
associated with the final phase. The situation has evolved beyond the
original scope of the contract.”</p><p>“Expense is not a concern. Results are the only consideration.”</p><p>The visitor nodded and moved toward the door, then paused. “One
question, if I may. The subject—why is it so important that the
situation be resolved? The current irregularities seem relatively minor
in the grand scheme of things.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="53"><p>The figure behind the desk was quiet for a long moment, considering
whether to answer. “Because, my dear colleague, minor irregularities
have a tendency to become major problems if left unchecked. And major
problems require major solutions, which tend to be… expensive… and
attract unwanted attention.”</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>“I’m certain you do. Until our next meeting, then.”</p><p>The visitor left as quietly as they had arrived, and the office
returned to its state of midnight silence. The figure behind the desk
opened another ledger and began making new entries, the precise
handwriting filling page after page with plans, calculations, and
arrangements that would ensure the natural order of things was properly
maintained.</p><p>Outside, the city of Ankh-Morpork continued its nightly business,
unaware that its cosmic schedule was being carefully managed by
individuals who understood that some forms of mercy were too dangerous
to be permitted.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.10" id="chapter-9-the-domestic-consultation"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.10</span> Chapter 9: The Domestic
Consultation</h3></div><div class="page" data-page="54"><p>Vimes arrived home to find the front door of Ramkin Manor standing
open in a way that suggested either burglary or Lady Sybil’s complete
confidence in her ability to handle whatever might wander in. Given that
this was Lady Sybil, and that she had once subdued an entire dragon with
nothing but stern words and proper etiquette, Vimes suspected the
latter.</p><p>The manor itself was a testament to what happened when old money met
practical sensibility. The building had been in the Ramkin family for
generations, accumulating both dignity and a certain comfortable
shabbiness that suggested its owners were more concerned with substance
than appearance. The hallway was lined with portraits of distinguished
ancestors who had the sort of jaw-line that indicated centuries of
telling other people what to do and expecting to be obeyed.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="55"><p>Vimes followed the sound of voices upstairs to the nursery, which
Lady Sybil had transformed from the sort of sterile shrine to childhood
that most aristocratic families favored into something that actually
looked like children might live there. The walls were painted in
cheerful colors, the floors were scattered with toys that showed
evidence of actual use, and the overall atmosphere suggested that this
was a place where learning happened through curiosity rather than
discipline. He caught a glimpse of someone sweeping the hallway
outside—one of the new cleaning staff, perhaps, though he moved with
unusual economy of motion.</p><p>What was unusual was not Lady Sybil reading to Young Sam—that was as
regular as sunrise and considerably more reliable than most of
Ankh-Morpork’s municipal services. What was unusual was that Death was
sitting in the rocking chair next to her, apparently listening with rapt
attention to “The Little Match Girl.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="56"><p>“Sam!” Lady Sybil looked up with the sort of calm pleasure that most
people reserved for greeting expected dinner guests, rather than finding
their husband standing in the doorway gaping at an anthropomorphic
personification. “Your friend Death has been helping with story time. He
has quite an interesting perspective on classic literature.”</p><p>Lady Sybil’s reaction to Death’s presence was, Vimes reflected,
entirely typical. She had been raised in the sort of household where one
was taught to be polite to everyone, from visiting dignitaries to the
occasional supernatural entity that might drop by for tea. Her education
had included not only the usual accomplishments expected of a
lady—languages, music, and the management of large households—but also a
thorough grounding in what her governess had called “practical
metaphysics.”<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This was partly because the Ramkin
family had always moved in circles where one might encounter anything
from minor gods to major demons at dinner parties, and it was considered
poor form to commit social gaffes due to ignorance about the nature of
one’s fellow guests.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="57"><p>Moreover, Lady Sybil had spent years breeding dragons, which had
given her a practical understanding of the fact that the universe was
considerably stranger and more interesting than most people imagined.
Anyone who had successfully negotiated territorial disputes between
highly intelligent reptiles was unlikely to be fazed by Death dropping
by for a chat.</p><p>THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL IS A VERY POORLY STRUCTURED NARRATIVE, Death
observed. <span class="death-speech">THE ENDING IS UNNECESSARILY TRAGIC.</span></p><p>“Well, yes,” Lady Sybil agreed. “Though I suppose it’s meant to be a
cautionary tale about social inequality.”</p><p>Young Sam, who was three and had inherited his father’s practical
nature, looked up at Death with the sort of direct interest that only
small children can manage.</p><p>“Are you really Death?” he asked.</p><p><span class="death-speech">YES.</span></p><p>“Do you have a horse?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I HAVE BINKY. HE IS VERY RELIABLE.</span></p><p>“Can I ride him?”</p><p>I’<span class="death-speech">M AFRAID THAT WOULD BE… PREMATURE.</span></p><p>“Oh.” Young Sam considered this. “Do you want to hear about my toy
soldiers?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I WOULD FIND THAT EDUCATIONAL.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="58"><p>Vimes watched this exchange with the sort of bemused fascination
usually reserved for watching natural disasters unfold in slow
motion.</p><p>“Sybil,” he said carefully, “why is Death in our nursery?”</p><p>“Well, dear, he was very interested in our child-rearing
philosophies. Apparently, the literature on the subject is quite limited
where he comes from.” Lady Sybil turned a page. “And he’s been very
helpful. Did you know he’s memorized most of the classic fairy
tales?”</p><p>THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS ARE MUCH MORE ACCURATE, Death added. <span class="death-speech">BEFORE
THEY WERE… SANITIZED.</span></p><p>“Right,” Vimes said. “Well, that’s… educational.”</p><p>Young Sam had begun arranging his toy soldiers in formation,
explaining to Death the proper deployment of cavalry against infantry.
Death listened with the sort of attention usually reserved for military
briefings.</p><p>“He’s quite good with children, actually,” Lady Sybil observed. “Very
patient. And he doesn’t try to let Young Sam win at games, which is
refreshing.”</p><p>“You’ve been playing games?”</p><p>CHESS, Death said. <span class="death-speech">HE IS QUITE SKILLED FOR SOMEONE WHO STILL COUNTS
ON HIS FINGERS.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="59"><p>“I can count to twenty!” Young Sam announced proudly. “And Death
taught me a new song!”</p><p>“A song?” Vimes asked, with the sort of parental dread that came from
experience.</p><p>IT IS ABOUT SKELETONS, Death said defensively. <span class="death-speech">IT IS EDUCATIONAL.</span></p><p>“Of course it is.” Vimes settled into his chair, accepting that this
was apparently his life now. “Well, don’t let me interrupt story
time.”</p><p>Lady Sybil smiled and continued reading. Death occasionally
interjected with historical corrections or alternative endings that were
usually more optimistic than the originals. Young Sam fell asleep
somewhere during “Goldilocks and the Three Bears,” which Death had
helpfully reinterpreted as a cautionary tale about breaking and entering
and the importance of proper home security.</p><p>“Thank you for helping with bedtime,” Lady Sybil whispered as they
tiptoed out of the nursery.</p><p>I FOUND IT… ILLUMINATING, Death replied. <span class="death-speech">CHILDREN HAVE A VERY DIRECT
RELATIONSHIP WITH EXISTENCE.</span></p><p>“They do indeed. You’re welcome to visit anytime, you know. Sam could
use more friends who understand the importance of proper procedure.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="60"><p>Death nodded gravely and vanished, leaving behind the faint scent of
eternity and the definite impression that Young Sam’s bedtime stories
would never be quite the same again.</p><p>“He’s quite nice, really,” Lady Sybil observed. “Though I do think
his approach to fairy tales could use some work.”</p><p>Vimes just nodded, making a mental note to have a word with Death
about appropriate children’s literature. Though, knowing Death, he had
probably already considered the educational value of traditional stories
versus their psychological impact on developing minds.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.11" id="chapter-10-the-wedding-committee"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.11</span> Chapter 10: The Wedding
Committee</h3></div><div class="page" data-page="61"><p>Vimes arrived at the Watch House to find the main office transformed
into what appeared to be a strategic planning center for an operation of
considerable complexity. This was notable because the Watch House’s main
office was normally the sort of place where strategic planning involved
deciding whether to arrest someone today or wait until tomorrow when
they might commit a crime that was actually worth the paperwork. A
maintenance worker was sweeping near the entrance, moving with the sort
of methodical precision that suggested either exceptional professional
pride or possibly a deep philosophical approach to janitorial work.</p><p>But what caught Vimes’s attention wasn’t the usual chaos of wedding
planning that had apparently overtaken his headquarters. It was the fact
that Sergeant Colon, Nobby Nobbs, and Constable Cheery were huddled
around Captain Carrot’s desk like generals planning a campaign,
surrounded by what appeared to be case files, crime scene photographs,
and a detailed map marked with red pins.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="62"><p>“…and then there’s the question of security,” Cheery was saying,
consulting a list that appeared to have been written in multiple hands,
several different languages, and at least one script that might have
been Dwarfish runes. “Because if someone’s targeting people who should
have died already, we need to think about who might be next.”</p><p>Vimes paused in the doorway. “Cheery, please tell me you’re not
planning Carrot’s wedding security based on a serial killer’s victim
selection criteria.”</p><p>“Actually, Commander,” Carrot said, looking up from what Vimes now
realized was a comprehensive analysis of Death’s “delayed transitions,”
“we’ve been cross-referencing the murder victims with the guest list.
It’s quite concerning.”</p><p>“How concerning?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="63"><p>“Well,” Nobby said cheerfully, pointing to a chart covered in
interconnected lines that resembled either a very complex family tree or
a diagram of criminal conspiracy, “turns out that three of the people
Death saved were supposed to be at weddings when they died. Margaret
Dowdy was killed the day after her daughter’s wedding, Thomas Keel was
meant to die in a carriage accident on his way to his nephew’s ceremony,
and Marcus Cripley had been hired to investigate insurance fraud at
wedding venues.”</p><p>“Wedding venues?”</p><p>“Yeah, apparently there’s been a lot of… accidents… at big society
weddings lately,” Colon explained, producing a file thick with incident
reports. “Chandelier collapses, food poisoning, mysterious fires. Always
during ceremonies that certain important people were attending.”</p><p>Vimes studied the map, noting the pattern of red pins clustered
around several of Ankh-Morpork’s more fashionable churches and reception
halls. “Someone’s been targeting weddings?”</p><p>“Not exactly targeting,” Cheery corrected. “More like… using them as
opportunities. Big gatherings, lots of confusion, easy to slip in and
out unnoticed.”</p><p>“And Death’s been preventing deaths at these events?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="64"><p>INDEED, said Death, materializing beside the desk with the sort of
timing that suggested he had been listening to the conversation from
whatever cosmic vantage point anthropomorphic personifications used for
surveillance purposes. <span class="death-speech">I HAVE BEEN… PARTICULARLY ATTENTIVE… TO OCCASIONS
OF JOY.</span></p><p>“Occasions of joy?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">WEDDINGS, BIRTHS, CELEBRATIONS. MOMENTS WHEN DEATH SEEMS…
INAPPROPRIATE.</span> Death gestured toward the crime scene photographs. <span class="death-speech">I HAVE
BEEN POSTPONING TRANSITIONS THAT WOULD INTERFERE WITH HAPPINESS.</span></p><p>“So our killer knows this, and is specifically targeting people whose
deaths you’ve delayed because they were celebrating something?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THAT APPEARS TO BE THE PATTERN, YES.</span></p><p>Carrot cleared his throat. “Which brings us to the security planning,
Commander. If Death has been protecting people at weddings, and someone
is systematically murdering those people…”</p><p>“Then my wedding might be a trap,” Vimes finished. “A way to draw out
either Death, or his protected targets, or both.”</p><p>“Actually,” Nobby said, consulting his notes, “we were thinking it
might be a way to draw out the killer. You know, controlled
circumstances, proper backup, all of us in fancy dress…”</p><p>“Nobby, you’re not wearing a bridesmaid dress to catch a serial
killer.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="65"><p>“But I’ve been practicing!”</p><p>Vimes studied the crime scene photographs spread across the
desk—Sarah Palmley’s squalid room, Thomas Keel’s broken body, Margaret
Dowdy’s poison-twisted face. Each image told the same story: people who
had died because someone decided their lives weren’t worth
preserving.</p><p>“You know what really pisses me off about this?” Vimes said, his
voice carrying the sort of controlled fury that made experienced
criminals suddenly remember urgent appointments elsewhere. “It’s not
just that someone’s murdering innocent people. It’s that they’re
murdering them for being inconvenient to a cosmic filing system.”</p><p>He picked up Sarah’s photograph, noting again the newspapers lining
her baby’s makeshift cot. “This woman died because Death decided a
newborn deserved her mother. Because for once, the universe showed a bit
of mercy. And someone decided that mercy was a mistake that needed
correcting.”</p><p>“Commander?” Carrot asked quietly.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="66"><p>“We’re not just chasing a killer, Carrot. We’re fighting a war
against the idea that some lives matter less than others. That poor
people, sick people, unlucky people should just die quietly and not
trouble the cosmic accountants.” Vimes’s cigar had gone out, but he
didn’t seem to notice. “And you know what the really sick part is? The
bastard we’re looking for probably thinks they’re doing the right thing.
Maintaining order. Following proper procedure.”</p><p>Death shifted uncomfortably. <span class="death-speech">I HAVE CREATED… COMPLICATIONS.</span></p><p>“No, Death. You’ve discovered something called conscience. The
complications were already there—you just started noticing them.” Vimes
turned to face his officers. “Right then. We’re going to catch this
murderer. But we’re not doing it to restore cosmic balance or maintain
universal order. We’re doing it because Sarah Palmley’s baby deserves to
grow up in a world where mercy isn’t considered a crime.”</p><p>“And because,” Nobby added cheerfully, “I look really good in
blue.”</p><p>“Nobby, you can’t be a bridesmaid.”</p><p>“Why not? I’ve got experience with formal dress. Remember the opera
thing?”</p><p>“That was undercover work.”</p><p>“This could be undercover work too. I could be investigating… wedding
crime.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="67"><p>“Wedding crime?”</p><p>“You know, cake theft, flower vandalism, inappropriate plus-ones.
Very serious stuff.”</p><p>Vimes looked around the room at his assembled officers, all of whom
were nodding as if this made perfect sense.</p><p>“Right,” he said finally. “Well, as long as this doesn’t interfere
with actual police work, I suppose it’s… harmless enough. But Nobby,
you’re not wearing a dress to Carrot’s wedding.”</p><p>“What about a nice frock?”</p><p>“No frocks either.”</p><p>“A tasteful ensemble?”</p><p>“Nobby, you’re going to wear your dress uniform, and you’re going to
like it.”</p><p>Nobby looked crestfallen. “But I look really good in blue.”</p><p>“Your dress uniform is blue.”</p><p>“I meant blue with ruffles.”</p><p>“No ruffles.”</p><p>The committee returned to their planning, now discussing seating
arrangements and whether it would be appropriate to have the wedding
cake decorated with tiny handcuffs (“for luck”). Vimes retreated to his
office, making a mental note to have a quiet word with Angua about what
her boyfriend’s colleagues were up to.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="68"><p>Outside his window, the city continued its eternal business of being
complicated and morally ambiguous, but inside the Watch House, love was
apparently being planned with military precision and an alarming amount
of input from Nobby Nobbs.</p><p>It was, Vimes reflected, either the most romantic thing he’d ever
witnessed, or the most elaborate practical joke in the history of law
enforcement. Possibly both.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.12" id="chapter-11-the-preservative-trail"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12</span> Chapter 11: The Preservative
Trail</h3><p>The morning after Cheery’s revelations about the mysterious
preservative chemicals, Vimes found himself standing outside Moribund’s,
one of Ankh-Morpork’s more specialized shops. The establishment occupied
a narrow building wedged between a respectable bakery and a shop that
claimed to sell “imported curiosities” but probably dealt in items that
customs officials preferred not to examine too closely.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="69"><p>Moribund’s catered to what the proprietor politely called “the
preservation trade”—taxidermists, collectors of rare specimens, and the
occasional individual whose hobby involved keeping things from decay in
ways that most people preferred not to think about too deeply. The
shop’s front window displayed an impressive collection of stuffed
animals, preserved flowers, and various bottles containing substances
that moved with an oily consistency that suggested they had opinions
about being disturbed.</p><p>The bell above the door chimed with a sound like distant church bells
as Vimes entered, followed by Cheery, who carried a small vial
containing the residue she’d found at the crime scenes. The interior of
the shop had the sort of atmosphere that suggested time moved
differently here—dust motes drifted lazily through shafts of colored
light, and the air carried scents of chemicals, old leather, and
something vaguely medicinal that might have been formaldehyde or
possibly something considerably more exotic.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="70"><p>Behind the counter stood Mr. Moribund himself, a thin man with the
sort of pale complexion that came from spending years in poorly
ventilated rooms working with chemicals that most people handled only
while wearing protective equipment. He had the precise, careful
movements of someone who understood that his materials could be
dangerous if mishandled, and his shop reflected this attention to
detail—everything was labeled, organized, and stored according to
principles that prioritized safety over convenience.</p><p>“Commander Vimes,” Moribund said, looking up from a ledger where he’d
been making entries in handwriting so small it might have been secret
code. “How may I assist the Watch today? I trust this isn’t about the
incident with Mrs. Colon’s cat again. I’ve told her repeatedly that
preservation requires advance planning. You can’t simply bring me an
animal that’s been deceased for a week and expect museum-quality
results.”</p><p>“Actually, Mr. Moribund, we’re hoping you might help us identify a
substance,” Vimes said. He gestured to Cheery, who approached the
counter with her vial.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="71"><p>“I found traces of this at several crime scenes,” Cheery explained,
setting the vial carefully on the counter. “It appears to be some sort
of preservative, but it’s unlike anything I’ve encountered in standard
forensic work.”</p><p>Moribund examined the vial with the sort of professional attention
that suggested both genuine interest and considerable expertise. He held
it up to the light, swirled the contents gently, and even opened it
briefly to sample the scent with the careful technique of someone who
had learned not to inhale unknown chemicals too enthusiastically.</p><p>“Interesting,” he murmured, closing the vial and setting it down with
careful precision. “This is quite specialized. Not the sort of thing one
uses for preserving flowers or small animals.”</p><p>“What sort of thing is it used for?”</p><p>“This particular formulation is designed for… larger specimens.
Human-sized, one might say. And it’s formulated to work very
quickly—most preservation processes require days or weeks to be fully
effective, but this would arrest decay almost immediately upon
application.”</p><p>Cheery made notes in her book. “Is it something you carry in
stock?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="72"><p>“Oh, no. Nothing like this. This is custom work—the sort of thing
that requires special ordering and considerable expertise to prepare
safely.” Moribund paused thoughtfully. “Though I suspect I know where it
might have come from.”</p><p>“Where?”</p><p>“There’s only one place in the city that deals in preservation
chemicals of this quality and specialization. Morbius and Company, down
in the Merchant Quarter. They supply materials to the university’s
medical school, the Guild of Embalmers, and… certain private collectors
who require discretion in their activities.”</p><p>Vimes felt the familiar tingle of recognition that came when an
investigation began to focus on specific leads. “Private
collectors?”</p><p>“There are individuals in Ankh-Morpork who have unusual hobbies,
Commander. Some collect stamps, some collect coins, others collect…
biological specimens. Morbius provides the materials necessary to
maintain such collections in pristine condition.”</p><p>“Would they keep records of their sales?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="73"><p>“Oh, most certainly. The Guild of Alchemists requires detailed
documentation for any materials that could be used in… irregular ways.
Though I should mention that Morbius is very discreet about his client
list. Professional confidentiality, you understand.”</p><p>Vimes thanked Moribund and left the shop with Cheery, both of them
now armed with a specific lead to follow. As they walked through the
twisting streets toward the Merchant Quarter, Vimes reflected that every
case seemed to lead eventually to someone with an unusual hobby and a
flexible relationship with conventional morality.</p><p>“Commander,” Cheery said as they navigated the crowds of mid-morning
shoppers and merchants, “if someone is using professional-grade
preservation chemicals, that suggests they have access to considerable
resources.”</p><p>“Meaning?”</p><p>“Meaning this isn’t just someone who decided to start killing people.
This is someone with connections, money, and knowledge of specialized
materials. Someone who treats murder like a technical problem to be
solved with the right equipment.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="74"><p>As they approached Morbius and Company—a respectable-looking
establishment with a discreet sign and windows that had been designed to
prevent casual observers from seeing too much of the interior—Vimes
found himself hoping that their investigation wouldn’t uncover anything
too horrible. In his experience, people who collected biological
specimens and had access to industrial-grade preservatives rarely
confined their interests to anything as innocent as pressed flowers or
butterflies.</p><p>“Right then, Cheery,” he said, pausing outside the shop to light a
cigar. “Let’s see what sort of customer might need enough preservation
chemicals to embalm a person quickly and efficiently.”</p><p>“And let’s hope,” Cheery added quietly, “that they don’t have a large
collection already.”</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.13" id="chapter-12-the-scent-and-the-scheme"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.13</span> Chapter 12: The Scent and
the Scheme</h3></div><div class="page" data-page="75"><p>Sergeant Angua was having the sort of morning that reminded her why
enhanced senses could be both a blessing and a curse. She had spent the
better part of an hour following a scent trail that led from Marcus
Cripley’s murder scene through half of Ankh-Morpork’s more respectable
neighborhoods, and what she had discovered was both illuminating and
deeply troubling.</p><p>The trail told a story that her human colleagues couldn’t have
detected without supernatural assistance. The killer had a distinctive
scent—not quite human, heavily contaminated with chemicals, and carrying
undertones that suggested both extreme cleanliness and something organic
that had been prevented from following its natural cycle of decay. It
was the smell of someone who worked regularly with preservation
processes, but also someone who had spent considerable time around…
preserved things.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="76"><p>The trail had led her to three separate locations before finally
terminating at a modest townhouse in Sator Square, a respectable address
occupied by people who valued privacy and could afford to maintain it.
The house itself was unremarkable—well-maintained but not ostentatious,
with the sort of architecture that suggested its owner preferred not to
attract attention. Clean windows, fresh paint, a small garden that
showed evidence of careful maintenance but no particular creativity.</p><p>What made Angua’s enhanced senses react with alarm was the scent
emanating from the building. Death. Not recent death, but old death that
had been… preserved. The chemical undertones she’d detected at the
murder scenes were much stronger here, mixed with other scents that
suggested the building housed a collection of biological specimens that
had been maintained in conditions that most people would find deeply
unsettling.</p><p>She was crouched behind a convenient shrub, making notes about the
building’s layout and the patterns of activity she could detect, when
Captain Carrot appeared beside her with the sort of quiet efficiency
that suggested he’d been practicing stealth techniques when no one was
looking.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="77"><p>“Anything interesting?” he asked quietly.</p><p>“The killer lives here,” Angua said without hesitation. “The scent
trail leads directly to this building, and the smells coming from
inside… Carrot, I think we’ve found someone who collects dead
things.”</p><p>“Dead things?”</p><p>“Preserved specimens. The whole place reeks of preservation chemicals
and old death. Not decomposition—death that’s been prevented from
decomposing.”</p><p>Carrot studied the building with the sort of methodical attention
that had made him the Watch’s most thorough investigator. “Any sign of
current activity?”</p><p>“Someone’s inside. Moving around on the upper floors. And there are
scents suggesting they’ve been here recently—within the last few
hours.”</p><p>They settled in to observe the building, noting the patterns of
activity within and the general layout of the surrounding area. The
neighborhood was quiet, populated by people who maintained regular
schedules and appeared to mind their own business with the sort of
determination that suggested they’d learned not to ask too many
questions about their neighbors’ hobbies.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="78"><p>After an hour of observation, during which they had confirmed that
the building was occupied by someone who kept irregular hours and rarely
opened the windows, Carrot produced a folder containing the insurance
fraud cases that Marcus Cripley had been investigating.</p><p>“I’ve been analyzing Cripley’s files,” he said, keeping his voice
low. “The pattern is quite disturbing. Someone has been staging
near-death experiences at social events—weddings, christenings,
anniversary celebrations—then collecting life insurance payouts when the
‘victims’ died of ‘unrelated’ causes weeks or months later.”</p><p>“Fake near-death experiences?”</p><p>“Not fake. Real. People who should have died but didn’t, then died
later when they were supposed to be safely recovered.” Carrot turned a
page, showing Angua a list of names, dates, and insurance companies.
“The insurance companies were starting to notice the pattern—too many
claims involving people who’d had dramatic recoveries followed by sudden
relapses.”</p><p>“So Cripley was investigating insurance fraud, but stumbled onto
actual murder.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="79"><p>“Exactly. And look at this.” Carrot pointed to a particular entry in
Cripley’s notes. “He identified a connection between all the suspicious
deaths. Someone with access to medical information, insurance records,
and detailed knowledge of the victims’ schedules.”</p><p>Angua studied the file, noting the meticulous documentation that had
probably cost Cripley his life. “Someone who knew exactly when and how
these people were supposed to die originally.”</p><p>“And who had the resources to stage believable near-death
experiences, then murder the victims later in ways that appeared to be
natural causes or accidents.”</p><p>“There’s something else,” Angua said, pointing to another entry.
“Cripley noted that the insurance payments weren’t going to normal
accounts. The money was being transferred to something called ‘Reality
Management Services’—a company that seems to exist only on paper. No
office, no employees, just a series of accounts that lead… nowhere.”</p><p>“That’s odd. Who would hire someone through a company that doesn’t
exist?”</p><p>“Someone who doesn’t want to be traced. Or…” Angua paused, her nose
twitching as she caught a faint scent. “Someone who might not be
entirely human.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="80"><p>As they continued their surveillance, a figure emerged from the
townhouse—average height, unremarkable appearance, wearing clothes that
suggested middle-class respectability without drawing attention to
themselves. The sort of person who could blend into crowds and be
forgotten as soon as you looked away.</p><p>But what caught Angua’s attention was the scent. This was definitely
their killer, carrying the distinctive mixture of preservation chemicals
and old death that she’d detected at all the crime scenes.</p><p>“That’s him,” she whispered to Carrot.</p><p>They followed at a discrete distance as the figure made its way
through the city streets with the sort of purposeful movement that
suggested someone on official business. The route led them through
several neighborhoods, past various shops and civic buildings, before
terminating at an office building in the financial district.</p><p>“Insurance offices,” Carrot observed, noting the signs displayed in
the building’s lobby. “Our killer works in insurance.”</p><p>“Which explains how they knew about the victims’ policies, their
medical histories, and their scheduled deaths,” Angua said. “They’ve
been using their access to cosmic scheduling information to commit
insurance fraud on a cosmic scale.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="81"><p>As they watched the building, both officers reflected that they had
uncovered something considerably more complex than a simple serial
killer. This was someone who had found a way to profit from Death’s
mercy, turning compassion into a business opportunity and treating
murder as a form of cosmic accounting.</p><p>“Commander Vimes needs to see this,” Carrot said, photographing the
building and making notes about their surveillance.</p><p>“Agreed. Though I suspect he’s not going to be pleased about the
bureaucratic implications.”</p><p>As they prepared to return to the Watch House with their findings,
Angua caught one more scent on the wind—something familiar, but not
quite identifiable. Something that reminded her of… eternity.</p><p>Death was taking an interest in these proceedings.</p><p>She just hoped he was on their side.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.14" id="chapter-13-administrative-complications"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.14</span> Chapter 13: Administrative
Complications</h3><p>The communication arrived with its usual precision—midnight exactly,
delivered through channels that left no trace of origin or destination.
The killer opened the encoded message with practiced efficiency, though
the contents proved more… challenging… than usual.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="82"><p><em>Subject surveillance protocols indicate elevated Watch attention.
Multiple investigations proceeding simultaneously. Recommend operational
review and possible procedural modifications. Maintain current
assignments but prepare contingency measures.</em></p><p>The killer made notes in the margin of their operational log. The
Watch was becoming inconveniently thorough in their investigation. This
was problematic but not unprecedented—law enforcement occasionally
demonstrated unexpected competence, requiring adaptation of standard
procedures.</p><p>More concerning was the message’s tone. Their employers valued
efficiency and discretion above all else. The fact that contingency
measures were being discussed suggested that the operation was
attracting the sort of attention that cosmic entities found…
unwelcome.</p><p>The killer reviewed their case files methodically, looking for
potential vulnerabilities in their operational security.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="83"><p><em>Subject: S. Palmley - No complications. Standard cleanup
protocols successful.</em> <em>Subject: T. Keel - Minor witness

Investigation target eliminated before complications could
develop.</em></p><p>Four successful corrections, each executed according to
specifications. The work had been professional, efficient, and
appropriately discrete. So why were their employers expressing concern
about Watch attention?</p><p>The answer, upon reflection, was probably methodological. The killer
had chosen varied techniques for each assignment—strangulation, blade
work, poison, blunt trauma—to avoid creating obvious patterns. But
perhaps the variety itself had become a pattern. Perhaps the Watch’s
investigative capabilities were more sophisticated than anticipated.</p><p>A second chime indicated another communication. The killer activated
the device with mounting concern.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="84"><p><em>Additional intelligence suggests Watch investigation has
identified connection between subjects. Recommend immediate
implementation of Protocol Seven: elimination of investigative
personnel. Authorization granted for expanded operational
parameters.</em></p><p>The killer paused in their note-taking. Protocol Seven was…
extensive. It involved targets beyond the original irregularities—anyone
who posed a threat to operational security. The Watch personnel, their
families, potentially their contacts and sources.</p><p>This represented a significant escalation from individual corrections
to systematic elimination of an entire investigative apparatus. The work
would be challenging, certainly, but more importantly, it suggested that
their employers were becoming concerned about exposure.</p><p>The killer had worked for these entities for several years, handling
various administrative corrections with consistent professionalism. The
arrangement had been mutually beneficial—the killer received
compensation and resources, while their employers maintained cosmic
order according to their preferred parameters. But Protocol Seven
suggested that the relationship was entering a more… complicated…
phase.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="85"><p>The killer stood and moved to the specialized cabinet where more
extensive equipment was stored. Protocol Seven would require items
beyond the standard precision instruments—explosive devices, wide-area
toxins, systems designed for multiple simultaneous eliminations rather
than individual corrections.</p><p>As they made preparations, the killer reflected on the philosophical
implications of their work. The original assignments had been clear:
correct scheduling irregularities, restore proper order, maintain cosmic
efficiency. These were noble goals, achieved through precise application
of professional expertise.</p><p>But eliminating Watch personnel for investigating murders… that felt
less like cosmic correction and more like simple crime prevention. The
distinction was subtle but important. The killer preferred to think of
their work as serving higher purposes rather than merely covering up
evidence of previous activities.</p><p>Another communication arrived, this one marked with the sort of
urgent designations that suggested immediate implementation was
expected.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="86"><p><em>Time parameters for Protocol Seven: 48 hours maximum. Begin with
primary investigative personnel, expand to secondary contacts as
necessary. Utilize maximum efficiency protocols. Discretion remains
paramount but secondary to completion.</em></p><p>Forty-eight hours to eliminate an entire police investigation. The
killer began calculating resource requirements, timing considerations,
and logistical challenges. It would require everything in their arsenal
plus several items that would need to be acquired through specialized
channels.</p><p>More troubling was the implication that their employers were willing
to sacrifice discretion for speed. This suggested either desperation or
external pressure that made the normal procedural considerations
irrelevant.</p><p>The killer sealed the communication devices and began methodical
preparation for what would either be the culmination of their
professional career or its unfortunate termination. Protocol Seven had
never been fully implemented before—the theoretical frameworks existed,
but practical application remained untested.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="87"><p>Still, the work was what the work was. Their employers valued results
over philosophical concerns, and the killer had built their reputation
on delivering exactly what was requested, when it was requested,
according to specifications.</p><p>They returned to their desk and began finalizing plans for the
elimination of Commander Vimes, his immediate subordinates, and anyone
else who posed a threat to the beautiful order that their employers
sought to maintain.</p><p>It was, after all, just another job. Simply larger in scope than
previous assignments.</p><p>The killer checked their pocket watch. Forty-seven hours and
thirty-three minutes until Protocol Seven implementation was
complete.</p><p>Time to begin.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.15" id="chapter-14-the-explanation"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.15</span> Chapter 14: The

<span class="death-speech">THERE ARE… ENTITIES… WHO VALUE PROCEDURE ABOVE COMPASSION. THEY CONSIDER

CORRECTION.</span></p><p>“That’s sick.” Vimes lit a cigar, noting how the flame seemed
steadier in Death’s presence. “So our victims - Sarah Palmley, Thomas
Keel, Margaret Dowdy, Marcus Cripley - they all lived past their
appointed time because you decided to be decent.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I PREFER TO THINK OF IT AS… PROPER TIMING.</span></p><p>“And now someone’s murdering them for your kindness.”</p><p>Death considered this with the sort of attention usually reserved for

for his coat. “Right then. I think it’s time we caught this killer

SOMEONE TO CORRECT IRREGULARITIES.</span></p><p>“A cosmic hit man.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THAT WOULD BE AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION.</span></p><p>As they prepared to leave the Watch House, Vimes reflected that his
job had just gotten considerably more complicated. It was one thing to
police a city where the criminals were merely human. It was quite
another to investigate murders committed on behalf of beings who
considered the entire universe to be insufficiently organized.</p><p>Still, he’d dealt with worse odds. Probably.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="91"><p>“Right then, Death. Let’s go prevent a murder and catch a
killer.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">WHERE ARE WE GOING?</span></p><p>“To save Robert Tinsdale’s life, and to get the evidence we need to
solve this case properly.”</p><p>As they left the Watch House, Vimes reflected that it was probably
the first time in his career that he’d gone to solve a case with Death
as his partner. It was either going to be very efficient, or it was
going to create paperwork that would haunt him for the rest of his
considerably extended life.</p><p>Either way, it was bound to be interesting.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.16" id="chapter-14-the-briefing"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.16</span> Chapter 14: The
Briefing</h3><p>The next morning, Vimes called an all-hands meeting in the Watch
House’s main office. The timing was strategic—early enough that everyone
was present but late enough that the coffee had had time to work its
municipal magic on the assembled officers. The room had been cleared of
the wedding planning materials that had taken up permanent residence
there, and in their place was the sort of organized chaos that suggested
serious police work was about to happen.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="92"><p>The evidence board dominated one wall, covered with photographs,
maps, timelines, and the red string that connected everything to
everything else in ways that made perfect sense if you understood how
police investigations actually worked. Captain Carrot had prepared a
comprehensive summary of their findings, Cheery had organized her
forensic evidence with military precision, and even Nobby had managed to
contribute a surprisingly coherent report about the insurance fraud
connections, though he kept adjusting his collar in a way that suggested
he was still getting used to wearing normal clothes again.</p><p>Constable Reg Shoe sat in the back, taking notes with the methodical
attention of someone who understood that paperwork was eternal, even if
you weren’t. As the Watch’s only undead officer, he had been following
the case with particular interest, especially since it seemed to involve
fundamental questions about the nature of death and whether people had
the right to remain alive past their scheduled expiration dates.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="93"><p>“Right then,” Vimes said, surveying his assembled officers with the
sort of grim satisfaction that came from finally having enough pieces of
the puzzle to see the complete picture. “I’ve got some new information
about our killer, and about why these particular people were
targeted.”</p><p>He lit a cigar, using the few seconds of ritual to organize his
thoughts. What he was about to tell them was going to sound completely
mad, but it was also the truth, and his officers deserved to know what
they were really dealing with.</p><p>“Our victims—Sarah Palmley, Thomas Keel, Margaret Dowdy, Marcus
Cripley—weren’t killed because of who they were. They were killed
because of when they didn’t die.”</p><p>“Commander?” Carrot asked, though his expression suggested he was
following the logic even if the implications were disturbing.</p><p>“Each of these people should have died months ago. Sarah in
childbirth, Thomas in his carriage accident, Margaret from consumption,
Marcus from a dozen different close calls. But something intervened.
Someone decided their deaths would be… inappropriate… at those
particular moments.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="94"><p>Vimes took a drag on his cigar, noting how his officers were
listening with the sort of focused attention that suggested they trusted
his judgment even when his explanations ventured into territory that
most people preferred to leave unexplored.</p><p>“Someone showed them mercy. Postponed their scheduled deaths because
the timing was wrong—too sad, too cruel, too disruptive to moments of
joy or hope.”</p><p>“Scheduled deaths?” Angua asked quietly.</p><p>“Everyone has an appointed time. When that time comes, you die. It’s
efficient, it’s orderly, it’s been working for centuries. But recently,
there have been… administrative irregularities. People who should have
died were allowed to live a bit longer.”</p><p>Colon raised his hand tentatively. “Commander, how do we know all
this? I mean, who keeps track of when people are supposed to die?”</p><p>This was the question Vimes had been dreading. How do you explain
that Death himself had told you about cosmic scheduling without sounding
like you’d been spending too much time sampling evidence from drug
busts?</p></div><div class="page" data-page="95"><p>“I have… sources… with access to information about these matters,” he
said carefully. “The important thing is that someone with considerable
resources has decided these postponements represent errors that need
correcting.”</p><p>“Someone’s killing people for not dying on schedule?” Cheery asked,
though her expression suggested she was already working out the forensic
implications.</p><p>“Now hang on just a minute,” Reg Shoe interrupted, his voice carrying
the sort of righteous indignation that came from someone who had
personal experience with irregular death scheduling. “Are you telling me
that people are being murdered for <em>not</em> dying when they were
supposed to?”</p><p>“That’s right, Reg.”</p><p>“That’s absolutely outrageous!” Reg stood up, waving his notebook. “I
died when I was supposed to, and I’m still working! What’s their excuse?
If these cosmic entities have a problem with people not staying dead,
they should take it up with the proper authorities, not hire
assassins!”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="96"><p>“Exactly. They’ve hired a professional—someone with access to
specialized preservation chemicals, detailed knowledge of their victims’
backgrounds, and the sort of methodical approach that treats murder like
administrative cleanup.”</p><p>Nobby squinted at the evidence board. “So we’re looking for someone
who works in… cosmic scheduling?”</p><p>“More likely someone who works in insurance and has contacts with…
higher authorities… who value order over individual circumstances.”
Vimes gestured toward the files that Carrot and Angua had compiled. “The
insurance fraud angle fits—someone using their access to mortality data
to profit from postponed deaths.”</p><p>“Right,” Carrot said, consulting his notes. “So we’re dealing with
someone who has connections to both the insurance industry and whatever…
entities… manage cosmic scheduling.”</p><p>“That’s a very specific job description,” Angua observed.</p><p>“Indeed it is. Which should make them easier to find.” Vimes stubbed
out his cigar. “The question is: do we arrest them for murder, insurance
fraud, or cosmic interference in municipal affairs?”</p><p>“Can we charge someone with cosmic interference?” Colon asked
hopefully.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="97"><p>“I’m sure Lord Vetinari will have opinions about jurisdiction,” Vimes
said. “But first we catch them. Angua, you said you’ve tracked the scent
to a specific building?”</p><p>“Sator Square. Someone who definitely works with preservation
chemicals and spends time around… preserved specimens.”</p><p>“Right then. We’re going to pay them a visit. But first, let’s hear
what our investigation has turned up.” Vimes gestured to Carrot and
Angua. “Captain, Sergeant—tell us what you’ve found.”</p><p>Carrot stepped forward with his notebook. “We’ve identified our
suspect’s location and probable occupation. The scent trail Angua
followed led to a townhouse in Sator Square—Number 15, to be precise.
The building houses someone who works extensively with preservation
chemicals.”</p><p>“And the insurance connection?” Vimes prompted.</p><p>“Marcus Cripley’s files were quite comprehensive. He’d identified a
pattern of fraudulent claims involving people who’d had near-death
experiences at social events, then died later when they should have been
recovering. The insurance companies were getting suspicious about the
statistical anomalies.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="98"><p>Angua consulted her own notes. “The scent trail also led to the
offices of Mutual Assurance and Benevolent Protection—it’s a mid-level
insurance company in the financial district. Our suspect works there,
probably in claims assessment or risk evaluation.”</p><p>“Someone with access to both customer medical histories and mortality
statistics,” Carrot added. “They’d know exactly who was supposed to die
when, and they’d be in a position to profit from… correcting the
schedule.”</p><p>“The preservation chemicals suggest they’re also involved in specimen
collection,” Angua continued. “The building in Sator Square contains
extensive collections of… biological materials. Preserved. The scents
are quite disturbing.”</p><p>Cheery held up her analysis. “The chemicals used on our victims are
expensive and specialized. Someone’s been ordering them in bulk from
Morbius and Company—enough to preserve dozens of human-sized
specimens.”</p><p>Vimes felt the pieces clicking together. “So we have someone who
works in insurance, has access to cosmic death schedules, collects
preserved specimens as a hobby, and considers postponed deaths to be a
business opportunity.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="99"><p>“There’s one more thing,” Carrot said quietly. “The insurance records
show our suspect has been filing claims on their own policies. Life
insurance, taken out on people they knew were scheduled to die. When
those deaths were postponed, they killed the victims themselves and
collected the payouts.”</p><p>“They’ve been profiting from both ends,” Angua realized.
“Professional fees for ‘correcting cosmic errors’ and insurance payouts
from their victims’ deaths.”</p><p>“Right then. We’re going to pay them a visit. But remember—this isn’t
just a murderer we’re dealing with. This is someone who considers mercy
to be a cosmic error. They think compassion disrupts the natural order
of things, and they’ve found a way to profit from restoring it.”</p><p>“That’s sick,” Colon said with feeling.</p><p>“Yes, it is. Which is why we’re going to stop them.” Vimes looked
around the room at his officers, noting the sort of determined
expressions that suggested they understood exactly what they were
fighting for. “Any questions about the case that don’t involve asking me
to reveal my sources?”</p><p>There was a moment of silence as everyone processed the information.
Finally, Nobby raised his hand.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="100"><p>“Commander, when you say cosmic entities… do you mean like gods? Or
more like really big filing clerks?”</p><p>“Both, Nobby. Definitely both.”</p><p>As the meeting broke up, with officers dispersing to their various
assignments, Vimes reflected that he had managed to brief his team on
the essential facts without actually explaining how he’d learned them.
His relationship with Death would remain private, but his officers now
understood what they were really dealing with: someone who considered
murder to be a form of cosmic accounting.</p><p>It was, he thought, enough truth to do the job without revealing
anything that would require even more complicated explanations.</p><p>Some secrets were worth keeping, especially when they involved
friendships that transcended the normal boundaries between life and
whatever came after.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.17" id="chapter-15-the-visit"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.17</span> Chapter 15: The Visit</h3></div><div class="page" data-page="101"><p>Number 15 Sator Square was the sort of building that apologized for
existing. Not ostentatiously shabby enough to attract the attention of
municipal improvement societies, nor well-maintained enough to suggest
its owner had money worth stealing, it occupied that perfect middle
ground of architectural respectability that allowed its occupant to
blend seamlessly into the urban landscape.</p><p>The building stood three stories tall, with the sort of narrow
windows that suggested either a desire for privacy or a reluctance to
pay window tax. The front door was painted a color that might once have
been green but had faded to something that could charitably be called
“municipal beige.” A small brass nameplate beside the door read “<span class="death-speech">A.
M</span>ortimer,” which was either the most ironic name possible for someone in
the death business or exactly the sort of name that cosmic entities with
limited imagination might choose for their earthly representative.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="102"><p>Vimes stood across the square with Captain Carrot, Sergeant Angua,
and Sergeant Detritus, studying the building with the sort of
professional attention that suggested they were planning something
considerably more complex than a social call. The morning light cast
long shadows across the square, and the general atmosphere suggested
that whatever happened next would probably require paperwork.</p><p>“Right then,” Vimes said, checking his notebook. “A. Mortimer, claims
assessor for Mutual Assurance and Benevolent Protection, probable
collector of preserved specimens, suspected of killing people for not
dying on schedule. Anyone have any better ideas about how to approach
this than knocking on the door and asking politely about their
hobbies?”</p><p>“We could wait for them to leave and search the premises,” Carrot
suggested, though his tone indicated he understood this wasn’t really an
option.</p><p>“We could surround the building,” Angua added. “Though if they have a
collection of preserved specimens, we might want to be prepared for…
unpleasant discoveries.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="103"><p>“We could just arrest them,” Detritus said, in the tone of someone
who considered direct action to be the most efficient solution to most
problems. “Dat much easier dan talking.”</p><p>Vimes considered these options while studying the building. The
windows were clean but curtained, the small front garden was maintained
but not creative, and the overall impression was of someone who
preferred not to attract attention to themselves or their
activities.</p><p>“No,” he said finally. “We’re going to do this properly. Official
visit, formal questioning, everything according to regulations. If <span class="death-speech">A.
M</span>ortimer wants to explain why they’ve been murdering people for cosmic
schedule violations, they’ll have the opportunity to do so in an
official capacity.”</p><p>They crossed the square with the sort of measured pace that suggested
serious official business was taking place. Carrot had prepared a
comprehensive list of questions, Angua was tracking scents that told
stories about the building’s inhabitants, and Detritus carried his
crossbow with the sort of casual confidence that suggested he was
prepared for whatever they might encounter.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="104"><p>Vimes knocked on the door with the sort of authoritative rap that
suggested the Watch was here on business and expected to be taken
seriously.</p><p>The door opened to reveal a person whose most striking feature was
how determinedly unremarkable they appeared—average height, bland
features, wearing clothes that suggested middle-class respectability
without drawing attention to themselves. But Vimes, with three decades
of reading people, noticed the details: hands that were too clean, as if
scrubbed with something stronger than soap. Eyes that moved constantly,
cataloguing exits and potential weapons. The sort of stillness that came
from someone who had learned to suppress every natural human gesture
that might betray personality.</p><p>“Yes?” The voice was carefully modulated, neither friendly nor
hostile, but there was something underneath—a faint accent that
suggested education, breeding even. This wasn’t someone who had fallen
into murder. This was someone who had chosen it as a career path.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="105"><p>“A. Mortimer?” Vimes showed his badge, noting how Mortimer’s gaze
fixed on it with the intensity of someone calculating threat levels.
“Commander Sam Vimes, Ankh-Morpork City Watch. We’d like to ask you some
questions about your work with Mutual Assurance and Benevolent
Protection.”</p><p>“Ah.” Mortimer’s expression didn’t change, but their hands moved
slightly—not quite reaching for anything, but positioning themselves.
Someone with combat training, Vimes realized. “I wondered when you’d
arrive. I’ve been rather expecting this conversation. I suppose you’d
better come in.”</p><p>The interior of the house was exactly what Vimes had expected from
someone who treated murder as a technical problem requiring specialized
equipment. The front room was furnished with the sort of careful
neutrality that suggested its occupant spent no more time here than
necessary. Clean, organized, and entirely without personality.</p><p>“Please, sit down,” Mortimer said, gesturing to chairs that looked
like they had been selected more for functionality than comfort. “I
assume this is about my recent claims assessments?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="106"><p>“Among other things,” Vimes said, settling into a chair that creaked
ominously under his weight. “We’re investigating a series of
murders—people who died under circumstances that suggest professional
expertise and access to specialized preservation chemicals.”</p><p>“I see.” Mortimer nodded as if this was a perfectly reasonable topic
of conversation. “And you believe I might have information relevant to
your investigation?”</p><p>“We believe you might have considerably more than information,”
Carrot said, consulting his notebook. “We’ve traced the preservation
chemicals used at the crime scenes to purchases made by someone matching
your description. We’ve also identified a pattern of insurance fraud
involving people who survived near-death experiences.”</p><p>“And,” Angua added quietly, “the scents in this building suggest
you’ve been working with preserved biological specimens. Recently.”</p><p>Mortimer considered this information with the sort of calm attention
that most people reserved for weather reports or tax assessments.</p><p>“I see you’ve been thorough,” they said finally, and for the first
time, something like genuine emotion crept into their voice—not fear,
but a kind of professional appreciation. “How much do you know about
cosmic scheduling irregularities?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="107"><p>“Enough to know that some people consider mercy to be an error
requiring correction,” Vimes said. “Care to explain your perspective on
the matter?”</p><p>Mortimer was quiet for a moment, then moved to a cabinet and poured
themselves a glass of what appeared to be expensive brandy. They didn’t
offer any to their guests—a telling detail about someone who lived
entirely for themselves.</p><p>“Commander, my family has served the cosmic order for seven
generations. Insurance, actuarial science, statistical analysis—we’ve
always been in the business of calculating risk and managing
uncertainty.” Mortimer took a sip. “When I was approached by the
Auditors, it wasn’t just a job offer. It was a calling. A chance to
serve something greater than municipal concerns or individual
sentiment.”</p><p>“So you decided to restore that order?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="108"><p>“I believed I was preventing chaos. Each postponed death creates
ripple effects—economic disruption, emotional trauma for families who
have to watch loved ones suffer, resources wasted on medical care that
only delays the inevitable.” Mortimer’s voice carried the conviction of
someone who had convinced themselves their work was noble. “The Auditors
showed me the mathematics. Sarah Palmley’s baby would have been better
off in an orphanage than growing up in poverty. Thomas Keel’s accident
would have saved his family years of caring for someone with chronic
injuries. I thought I was being merciful.”</p><p>“You mean someone who could murder people and make it look like
natural causes,” Detritus said, his voice carrying the sort of blunt
honesty that came from someone who had never seen any point in polite
euphemisms.</p><p>“I prefer to think of it as quality control. The universe operates
according to specific parameters. When those parameters are violated,
adjustments must be made.”</p><p>Vimes felt his old copper’s instincts kicking in—the combination of
anger and professional satisfaction that came from confronting someone
who thought they could explain away murder with bureaucratic
language.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="109"><p>“These entities,” Vimes said carefully. “Got names, do they?”</p><p>Mortimer’s composure flickered for the first time. “They call
themselves… the Auditors of Reality. They ensure that existence follows
proper procedures. Life, in their view, is acceptable only when it
conforms to established patterns. Deviations must be… corrected.”</p><p>“And they pay well for murder?”</p><p>“They don’t see it as murder. To them, these people were already
dead—their continued existence was simply a filing error that needed to
be resolved. I was merely… implementing necessary corrections to the
cosmic ledger.”</p><p>“Right,” Vimes said, his voice carrying a dangerous edge. “And what
happens when they decide you’re an irregularity that needs
correcting?”</p><p>For the first time, genuine fear flickered across Mortimer’s face.
They set down the brandy glass with hands that weren’t quite steady. “I…
that hadn’t occurred to me. But I’m not an irregularity. I’m their
solution.”</p><p>“Are you? Because from where I sit, you look like someone who’s been
skimming from the cosmic order. Fifty thousand dollars in fraudulent
insurance claims, according to our investigation. I wonder what the
Auditors think about employees who profit from their work?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="110"><p>Mortimer’s carefully maintained composure cracked entirely. “How did
you… that was completely separate from the quality control program!”</p><p>“Was it? Sarah Palmley,” Vimes continued relentlessly. “New mother.
Strangled with her own shawl. But not before you collected on the life
insurance policy you’d taken out on her six months ago, betting she
wouldn’t survive childbirth.”</p><p>“She was scheduled to die in childbirth. Her survival created
statistical anomalies that required correction.”</p><p>“Thomas Keel. On his way to his nephew’s wedding. How much did you
collect when he survived that carriage accident?”</p><p>“The accident was meant to be fatal. His survival disrupted the
cosmic schedule.”</p><p>“Quality control,” Vimes repeated, his voice carrying the sort of
dangerous calm that suggested someone was about to have a very bad day.
“Right then, A. Mortimer. You’re under arrest for the murders of Sarah
Palmley, Thomas Keel, Margaret Dowdy, and Marcus Cripley. And for cosmic
conspiracy to commit murder on behalf of interdimensional
bureaucrats.”</p><p>Detritus stepped forward, looming over Mortimer with the sort of
presence that suggested resistance would be both futile and inadvisable.
“Dat means you come wit us now,” he explained helpfully.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="111"><p>Mortimer looked up at the seven-foot troll and appeared to reach the
conclusion that cooperation was the wisest course of action.</p><p>As Carrot produced the handcuffs and began reciting the formal
charges, Vimes reflected that some cases were simpler than they
initially appeared. Sometimes evil really was just bureaucracy taken to
its logical conclusion—the reduction of human lives to data points in
someone else’s filing system.</p><p>And sometimes the best response to cosmic order was good
old-fashioned justice, applied with whatever force necessary to remind
the universe that some things were worth fighting for.</p><p>As they led Mortimer away, Vimes felt a chill that had nothing to do
with the weather. Somewhere in the spaces between realities, entities
that valued order above existence had just learned that their earthly
operative had been compromised.</p><p>The real threat, he suspected, was just beginning.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.18" id="chapter-16-the-cosmic-committee-meeting"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.18</span> Chapter 16: The Cosmic
Committee Meeting</h3></div><div class="page" data-page="112"><p>In a space that existed between dimensions, where geometry was
optional and time moved according to bureaucratic necessity rather than
physical law, three entities convened for what they termed an “emergency
consultation regarding operational irregularities.”</p><p>The Auditors of Reality existed in perfect uniformity, their gray
robes indistinguishable from the gray void that surrounded them. They
had no faces because faces implied individuality, and individuality was
an error in the cosmic filing system. When they spoke, their voices
carried the authority of beings who had never experienced doubt,
creativity, or the slightest deviation from universal regulations.</p><p>“IRREGULARITY REPORT,” announced the first Auditor, producing what
appeared to be a file folder that somehow managed to be even more gray
than everything else in the space. “<span class="death-speech">OPERATIVE DESIGNATION: A. MORTIMER.

the answer with the sort of mathematical certainty that made actual
conversation unnecessary. The Auditors conducted meetings not because
they needed to exchange information, but because proper procedure
required documentation of all decisions.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="113"><p>“<span class="death-speech">THE OPERATIVE HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES. INTERROGATION

probability adjustments, “THE PRIMARY IRREGULARITY—<span class="death-speech">DESIGNATION: VIMES,

dimensions seemed to shiver slightly, as if reality itself was nervous
about what had just been decided.</p><p>Somewhere in the city of Ankh-Morpork, a certain Commander of the
City Watch was about to discover that his biggest problem wasn’t
municipal crime or cosmic irregularities.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="117"><p>His biggest problem was that he had become interesting enough for
cosmic entities to hold committee meetings about him.</p><p>And cosmic entities, as a general rule, preferred their universes to
be considerably less interesting.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.19" id="chapter-17-the-unconventional-patrol"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.19</span> Chapter 17: The
Unconventional Patrol</h3><p>Vimes was doing his evening rounds through the more respectable parts
of the city—the sort of neighborhood where the criminals wore better
clothes and committed more expensive crimes, but were generally more
polite about it. The transition from the Shades to Scoone Avenue was
like stepping from one world into another, or possibly from one century
into another, depending on one’s perspective on urban development and
social progress.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="118"><p>Scoone Avenue represented Ankh-Morpork’s attempt at genteel
respectability. The buildings were taller, cleaner, and showed evidence
of recent maintenance. The streets were wider, the lighting was better,
and the general atmosphere suggested that this was a place where people
worried more about property values than immediate survival. It was the
sort of neighborhood where crime was conducted with proper paperwork and
a reasonable respect for social conventions.</p><p>The evening light cast long shadows between the well-maintained
buildings, creating the sort of urban landscape that suggested
civilization had made a serious effort and was quite pleased with the
results. Gas lamps provided pools of warm light at regular intervals,
and the overall effect was considerably more wholesome than anything the
Shades had to offer. This was probably why Vimes always felt slightly
uncomfortable here—too much wholesomeness made him suspicious.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="119"><p>He was contemplating the philosophical implications of municipal
lighting policy when he spotted two figures on patrol near the
intersection with Treacle Mine Road. One was clearly Sergeant Colon,
instantly recognizable by his distinctive waddle and the way he held his
truncheon like it might suddenly develop teeth and attempt to bite him.
Colon’s approach to law enforcement was based on the theory that most
criminals could be discouraged through the application of reasonable
conversation and the implied threat of paperwork.</p><p>The other figure appeared to be a woman in a blue dress and bonnet,
walking with a gait that suggested either recent injury, unfamiliarity
with feminine footwear, or possibly both. The dress was clearly
expensive—silk, by the look of it—but it had been fitted to someone with
dramatically different proportions than its current wearer. The overall
effect was less “elegant lady” and more “person attempting to
impersonate an elegant lady based on written descriptions.”</p><p>Vimes approached with the sort of professional interest that came
from years of recognizing trouble before it fully materialized.</p><p>“Evening, Sergeant,” he called out.</p><p>Colon spun around with the guilty expression of a man caught doing
something he couldn’t quite explain.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="120"><p>“Oh! Commander! Lovely evening for a patrol, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Indeed. And your… companion?”</p><p>The woman in blue turned around, revealing a face that was definitely
familiar despite the application of what appeared to be Lady Sybil’s
rouge and powder.</p><p>“Evening, Mister Vimes!” Nobby said in a voice pitched approximately
three octaves higher than usual. “Lovely night, isn’t it? Perfect for…
patrol activities.”</p><p>Vimes stared. “Nobby, why are you wearing a dress?”</p><p>“Dress?” Nobby looked down at himself as if noticing his attire for
the first time. “This old thing? It’s not a dress, it’s a… tactical
urban camouflage ensemble.”</p><p>“It’s a dress, Nobby.”</p><p>“Well, technically, yes. But it’s for police work!”</p><p>“Police work.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Nobby’s enthusiasm was only slightly dampened by his attempt
to maintain a feminine voice. “See, we’ve been having trouble with that
pickpocket who’s been working the market, right? The one who only
targets lone women?”</p><p>“Go on.”</p><p>“Well, Sergeant Colon here had the brilliant idea that we could catch
him in the act. I volunteer to be the bait, being as I’m naturally…
compelling.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="121"><p>Vimes looked at Nobby, who was indeed compelling, though not
necessarily in the way they intended. The dress was blue silk, clearly
expensive, and appeared to have been borrowed from someone with
significantly different proportions. The bonnet was askew, the makeup
was applied with more enthusiasm than skill, and Nobby’s attempts at
walking in heels were producing a gait that could charitably be
described as “interpretive.”</p><p>“Compelling,” Vimes repeated.</p><p>“Oh yes,” Colon interjected. “Very convincing. We’ve had three
marriage proposals already.”</p><p>“Marriage proposals?”</p><p>“Well, two marriage proposals and one business proposition,” Nobby
corrected. “I told them I was already spoken for. Maintaining character,
you understand.”</p><p>“Character.”</p><p>“Yes! I’m Lady Nobitha of… er… Ankh. I’m new in town, looking for a
nice little shop to buy. Very innocent, very vulnerable, perfect
pickpocket bait.”</p><p>Vimes studied Nobby’s ensemble more carefully. “That’s Lady Sybil’s
dress.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="122"><p>“She said I could borrow it!” Nobby said quickly. “For official
police business! She was very understanding about the whole thing. Even
gave me tips on walking in heels.”</p><p>“Lady Sybil taught you to walk in heels.”</p><p>“She’s very supportive of innovative policing techniques. Also, she
said the blue brings out my eyes.”</p><p>Vimes closed his eyes and counted to ten. When he opened them, Nobby
was still there, still in a dress, still looking quite pleased.</p><p>“And has this… innovative technique… produced any results?”</p><p>“Well,” Colon said, “we did catch three pickpockets, two confidence
tricksters, and a man selling fake jewelry.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yeah, but they weren’t the ones we were looking for. Turns out
there’s a lot more crime in this area than we thought. Who knew women
had to deal with this sort of thing all the time?”</p><p>“Educational experience, then.”</p><p>“Very educational,” Nobby agreed. “Did you know that walking in heels
is basically a form of torture? And don’t get me started on this corset
thing. I don’t know how women breathe in these things.”</p><p>“You’re wearing a corset?”</p><p>“Lady Sybil insisted. Said it was important for proper posture and
authenticity. I think it’s cutting off circulation to my brain.”</p><p>“That would explain a lot,” Vimes muttered.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="123"><p>Just then, a young man approached the group with the sort of
confident swagger that usually preceded either a sales pitch or a
marriage proposal. He was well-dressed in the manner of someone who
wanted to appear more successful than he actually was, with rings on
every finger and a gold tooth that glinted when he smiled.</p><p>“Excuse me, miss,” he said to Nobby, sweeping off his hat with an
elaborate flourish, “but I couldn’t help noticing you from across the
street. Such elegance! Such poise! Might I introduce myself? Reginald
Threepwood, purveyor of fine exotic jewelry and precious stones from
across the Circle Sea.”</p><p>Nobby batted his eyelashes, which was a sight that would haunt
Vimes’s dreams for weeks.</p><p>“Oh my,” Nobby simpered, clasping his hands together in what was
presumably meant to be a feminine gesture of delight. “How very
exciting! I’m Lady Nobitha of… er… Upper Ankh. I’ve only just arrived in
the city and I’m positively overwhelmed by all the wonderful shops and…
things.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="124"><p>“Ah, a lady of refinement!” Threepwood’s eyes lit up with the
predatory gleam of a man who thought he’d found easy prey. “Then you’ll
appreciate quality when you see it. Allow me to show you some pieces
from my personal collection - jewels fit for royalty, madam, but priced
for the discerning lady of moderate means.”</p><p>He produced a velvet-lined case filled with what was obviously
theatrical jewelry - the sort of gaudy paste gems that looked impressive
in dim light but wouldn’t fool a child in daylight.</p><p>“This particular necklace,” he said, lifting a string of glass beads
with all the reverence of a priest handling sacred relics, “was worn by
the Empress of Klatch herself. Genuine rubies from the mines of Gebra,
each one worth a king’s ransom. Normally I wouldn’t part with such a
treasure for less than five hundred dollars, but for a lady of your
obvious taste and breeding…”</p><p>“Five hundred dollars?” Nobby gasped, fanning himself with what
appeared to be a lace handkerchief. “Oh dear, that does sound rather a
lot. You see, I’m just a poor widow, trying to make my way in the world
with only my dear departed husband’s small inheritance.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="125"><p>Vimes had to admire Nobby’s performance. The voice was pitch-perfect,
the gestures were convincingly feminine, and the widow story was a nice
touch that suggested both respectability and limited funds.</p><p>“A widow!” Threepwood’s expression became appropriately sympathetic
while his eyes calculated. “My dear lady, I had no idea. Please, allow
me to offer you a special price - say, two hundred dollars? I know it’s
still a considerable sum, but this necklace would complement your
natural beauty so perfectly…”</p><p>“Oh, but I don’t know anything about jewelry,” Nobby said helplessly.
“How can I be sure it’s genuine? I’ve heard there are unscrupulous
people in the city who might try to take advantage of a simple woman
like myself.”</p><p>“Madam! I am shocked that you would even suggest such a thing!”
Threepwood placed a hand over his heart with theatrical outrage. “These
are my credentials!” He produced a scroll covered in official-looking
seals. “Certified by the Guild of Jewelers and the Association of
Precious Metals!”</p><p>Vimes squinted at the scroll from where he stood. Even from a
distance, he could see it was a fishing license with some fancy borders
drawn on in colored ink.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="126"><p>“Well,” Nobby said, apparently studying the document with great care,
“if you’re sure it’s genuine… But perhaps I should ask my friend here
what he thinks?” He turned to gesture at Vimes. “This is my escort,
Mister… er… Ironfoundersson. He’s very wise about these matters.”</p><p>Threepwood’s face fell slightly as he took in Vimes’s uniform and
general air of authority.</p><p>“Ah. Your… escort. I see.” His smile became somewhat more strained.
“Well, I’m sure any friend of yours would recognize quality when they
see it.”</p><p>“Actually,” Vimes said, stepping forward with his best intimidating
copper expression, “I think I recognize you, Mr. Threepwood. Didn’t we
have a conversation last month about selling genuine Agatean silk that
turned out to be painted potato sacking? And before that, wasn’t there
something about you trying to join a pirate crew with a vegetable-based
sword fighting technique?”</p><p>Threepwood went pale. “I… that is… there must be some mistake… And it
was a root vegetable! Very cutting edge sword work, that was!”</p><p>“Right then,” Vimes said to Colon, “arrest him for attempting to
defraud Lady Nobitha here. And check his credentials - I suspect that
fishing license isn’t quite what he claims it is.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="127"><p>“My pleasure, Commander,” Colon said, producing his handcuffs with
evident satisfaction.</p><p>As Colon moved in for the arrest, Nobby turned to Vimes with a
triumphant grin.</p><p>“See? Effective policing through innovative disguise techniques!”</p><p>“Nobby, you’re never wearing that dress again.”</p><p>“What about for special occasions?”</p><p>“No special occasions.”</p><p>“Undercover work?”</p><p>“No undercover work.”</p><p>“What if Carrot needs a bridesmaid?”</p><p>Vimes started walking away. Behind him, he could hear Nobby
explaining to the arrested jewelry seller that they were actually a
policeman, which seemed to confuse the man more than the arrest
itself.</p><p>“But you’re wearing a dress!” the man protested.</p><p>“I’m a very modern policeman,” Nobby replied cheerfully.</p><p>Vimes reflected that the Watch had come a long way from the days when
their biggest challenge was staying sober long enough to collect their
wages. He wasn’t entirely sure it was progress, but it was certainly
never boring.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.20" id="chapter-18-the-revelation"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.20</span> Chapter 18: The
Revelation</h3></div><div class="page" data-page="128"><p>The case had developed into something considerably more complex than
a simple serial killing. Death appeared at random intervals with the
casual unpredictability of a natural phenomenon, manifesting during
meals, on patrol, while Vimes was wrestling with reports that seemed to
reproduce when he wasn’t looking, and once memorably while he was having
what could charitably be called a “progress meeting” with the Patrician
about the murder investigation.</p><p>That particular encounter had taken place in Lord Vetinari’s office,
a room that had been designed to make visitors feel simultaneously
impressed and slightly nauseous.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The office occupied a
space that was larger than it should have been, given the external
dimensions of the building, and was decorated in what could only be
described as “Aggressive Minimalism”—a style that suggested its occupant
was too important to require actual furniture, but wealthy enough to
afford very expensive empty space.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="129"><p>“Commander,” Vetinari had said without looking up from a document
that appeared to involve sulfur importation calculations, “I trust your
investigation into the recent… irregularities… is proceeding
satisfactorily? I’ve had some interesting correspondence about the
matter from certain elevated sources.”</p><p>“We’ve identified the pattern, my lord. Someone is systematically
killing people who’ve survived near-death experiences - people whose
deaths have been… postponed… for compassionate reasons.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. The scheduling irregularities.” Vetinari had set down his
document with careful precision. “I’ve been receiving complaints about
those from entities who value procedural correctness above individual
circumstances. They seem quite concerned about unauthorized mercy
interfering with proper cosmic administration.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="130"><p>During this discussion—which had rapidly evolved from case briefing
through diplomatic complexity to what military strategists would
recognize as interdimensional bureaucratic warfare—Death had simply
materialized in one of the chairs and sat listening with the sort of
professional interest that undertakers might show at a particularly
well-organized funeral. He had occasionally nodded as if taking mental
notes, though whether these concerned municipal finance, murder
investigation techniques, or the philosophical implications of cosmic
complaint procedures was unclear.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="131"><p>The Patrician, to his considerable credit, had barely raised an
eyebrow at this development. He had simply continued his explanation of
why the Watch’s budget requests were simultaneously too large, too
small, insufficiently detailed, and unnecessarily specific, while
occasionally glancing at Death with the sort of mild acknowledgment he
might show a colleague who had dropped by to observe an interesting
meeting. But then, Lord Vetinari was the sort of man who would have
managed to negotiate with the apocalypse, probably getting it to
reschedule for a more convenient time and possibly extracting some
concessions about the terms and conditions of universal destruction.</p><p>That particular meeting had been… educational. Vimes had noticed
someone sweeping the corridor outside Vetinari’s office during their
discussion—unusual, since the Patrician’s building was normally
maintained to standards that made most monasteries look sloppy. The
cleaner had worked with the sort of unhurried efficiency that suggested
either exceptional dedication to municipal tidiness or possibly a very
philosophical approach to maintenance work.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="132"><p>“Commander Vimes,” Lord Vetinari had said, barely glancing up from
his copy of the Ankh-Morpork Times, “I trust you are well? You look
rather… accompanied today.”</p><p>“I’m fine, my lord. Death is just… observing.”</p><p>“Ah. How civic-minded.” Vetinari had finally looked up, his gaze
taking in Death with the same mild interest he might show a new type of
filing cabinet. “Good morning, Death. I trust you are finding our
municipal processes… illuminating?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I AM LEARNING A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY.</span></p><p>“Excellent. One can never have too much education in the proper
functioning of civic institutions.” Vetinari turned a page with
deliberate precision. “I was just reading this fascinating article about
portable clacks towers. Apparently, some enterprising individual—a
Mr. Moist von Lipwig, I believe you know him, Commander—is developing a
system for installing them on carts. Mobile communication, as it
were.”</p><p>Vimes had glanced at Death, who was listening with what appeared to
be professional interest. “That’s… interesting, my lord.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="133"><p>“Indeed. The implications are quite staggering when one considers
them fully.” Vetinari steepled his fingers, a gesture that usually
preceded what Vimes privately called a ‘lecture disguised as a
conversation.’ “Imagine, if you will, the ability to coordinate across
vast distances in real-time. Military applications are obvious, of
course, but the commercial possibilities…” He paused, letting the
thought hang in the air like incense.</p><p>“Commercial possibilities, my lord?”</p><p>“Oh, Commander. Consider a merchant who could communicate instantly
with his warehouses, his ships, his… associates. No more delays, no more
uncertainty about cargo arrivals. Supply and demand could be balanced
with mathematical precision.” Vetinari’s smile was the sort that made
hardened criminals confess to things they hadn’t even thought of doing
yet.</p><p>Death leaned forward with what appeared to be genuine interest. <span class="death-speech">IT
SOUNDS LIKE A VERY… EFFICIENT SYSTEM.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="134"><p>“Precisely, Death. Efficiency is the cornerstone of civilization.
Though I can’t help but wonder about the implications for law
enforcement.” His eyes had taken on that particular gleam that meant he
was thinking several moves ahead of everyone else. “Imagine criminals
coordinating their activities across the city in real-time. Or worse…”
he paused for effect, “imagine if they could communicate while in moving
vehicles. Drive-by clackings, as it were.”</p><p>“Drive-by what now?” Vimes asked, though he suspected he already knew
where this was going.</p><p>“Oh, nothing immediate to concern yourself with, Commander. Though it
does raise interesting questions about the future of crime prevention.
How does one patrol a crime that moves at the speed of light?” Vetinari
appeared to consider this philosophical problem with genuine relish.</p><p>Death nodded thoughtfully. <span class="death-speech">THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS QUITE FAST.</span></p><p>“Indeed it is, Death. Though not, I suspect, faster than a
well-prepared mind.” Vetinari smiled. “Which brings us to the question
of preparedness. Commander, you might want to consider the budgetary
implications of equipping your officers with mobile clacks units. For
defensive purposes, naturally.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="135"><p>“My lord, we can barely afford stationary clacks units. The
Patrician’s Palace has better communication than the entire Watch
combined.”</p><p>“Yes, well. Perhaps we could discuss innovative funding solutions.”
Vetinari pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and began writing with the
sort of deliberate care usually reserved for signing death warrants.
“I’m sure the various Guilds would be interested in contributing to
civic communication infrastructure. For a modest licensing fee, of
course.”</p><p>Death watched this process with fascination. <span class="death-speech">YOU APPEAR TO BE SOLVING
MULTIPLE PROBLEMS SIMULTANEOUSLY.</span></p><p>“One tries to be efficient, Death. For instance, the Thieves’ Guild
would naturally want to ensure that their… activities… remain properly
regulated in an age of instant communication. A small contribution to
Watch communication upgrades would demonstrate their civic spirit.”</p><p>“You’re going to tax them for the privilege of being policed better,”
Vimes realized.</p><p>“Tax is such an ugly word, Commander. I prefer to think of it as…
subscription fees for municipal services. The Assassins’ Guild, for
example, would surely appreciate having better-equipped Watch officers.
It makes their work more… challenging.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="136"><p>“They’d pay for the privilege of being hunted more effectively?”</p><p>“Commander, you underestimate the professional pride of our city’s
Guilds. Excellence recognizes excellence. They would see improved Watch
capabilities as a mark of respect for their own skills.”</p><p>Death appeared to be taking mental notes. <span class="death-speech">THIS IS A VERY
SOPHISTICATED APPROACH TO RESOURCE ALLOCATION.</span></p><p>“Thank you, Death. One finds that the key to successful governance is
understanding that every problem is simply an opportunity viewed from
the wrong angle.” Vetinari finished writing and handed the paper to
Vimes. “Here’s a preliminary budget proposal. You’ll notice I’ve
included provisions for training, equipment maintenance, and a small
contingency fund for… unexpected developments.”</p><p>Vimes looked at the figures and blinked. “My lord, this budget is
larger than our current annual allocation.”</p><p>“Yes, well. One must plan for growth. Besides, I’ve already had
preliminary discussions with several Guild representatives. They seem
quite enthusiastic about the proposal.”</p><p>“You discussed this before the technology even existed?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="137"><p>“Commander, successful administration requires one to anticipate
needs before they become urgent. By the time mobile clacks become
commonplace, we’ll already have the infrastructure in place to manage
them properly.” Vetinari leaned back in his chair with the satisfied air
of a man who had just solved several problems that hadn’t happened
yet.</p><p>Death appeared genuinely impressed. <span class="death-speech">YOU HAVE TURNED A POTENTIAL
PROBLEM INTO A FUNDING OPPORTUNITY, A TRAINING EXERCISE, AND A
DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVE.</span></p><p>“Precisely, Death. Efficiency requires seeing the connections between
seemingly unrelated elements. Crime, technology, Guild politics,
municipal budgets—they’re all part of the same system. Change one
element, and you must adjust all the others accordingly.”</p><p>“Is there anything you haven’t thought of, my lord?” Vimes asked,
though he wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to know the answer.</p><p>“Well, Commander, I have been wondering about the potential
applications of this technology for… other purposes.” Vetinari’s smile
became thoughtful. “Imagine, for instance, the ability to conduct
government business remotely. Cabinet meetings via clacks. Remote voting
on municipal ordinances. Virtual court proceedings…”</p><p>“Virtual what?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="138"><p>“Oh, nothing immediate, Commander. Just… future considerations.
Though I should mention that I’ve asked Mr. Lipwig to include certain…
security features… in his mobile clacks design. For public safety,
naturally.”</p><p>The conversation had continued in this vein for some time, with Death
occasionally asking penetrating questions about governance theory and
resource management. Vimes had left the meeting with a headache, a new
budget proposal that somehow made financial sense despite being
mathematically impossible, three new policy initiatives he didn’t
remember agreeing to, and the distinct impression that Death was
learning far too much about the administrative complexities of modern
policing.</p><p>Also, he was fairly certain that Vetinari had somehow managed to get
Death to agree to serve as a consultant on municipal efficiency studies,
though he couldn’t quite remember how that had happened.</p><p>But then, the Patrician was the sort of man who would have managed to
negotiate with the apocalypse.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.21" id="chapter-19-the-scheduling-irregularity"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.21</span> Chapter 19: The Scheduling

cosmically ironic or simply the sort of thing that happened when you
were Sam Vimes and the universe had developed opinions about your
continued existence.</p><p>It had been three days since they’d arrested A. Mortimer for the
murders. Three days since Vimes had learned that cosmic entities called
the Auditors of Reality were hiring people to murder those shown mercy.
Three days for those same entities to realize their earthly operative
had been compromised.</p><p>Vimes had been walking home from the Watch House through the
relatively safe streets of the Temple Quarter, where the worst crimes
were usually disputes over theological interpretation and the occasional
aggressive charity collection. The evening was peaceful, the gas lamps
cast their usual pools of warm light, and the general atmosphere
suggested that even Ankh-Morpork’s criminal element had decided to take
the evening off. A temple maintenance worker was sweeping the steps of
one of the smaller shrines, working through the evening shadows with
patient thoroughness.</p><p>Which should have been his first warning that something was
wrong.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="140"><p>The crossbow bolt missed him by inches, embedding itself in a lamp
post with the sort of solid thunk that suggested serious professional
equipment and considerable expertise in its use. Vimes’s copper
instincts, honed by decades of surviving in a city where violence was
considered a form of aggressive municipal planning, had him moving
before his conscious mind registered the danger.</p><p>He rolled behind a convenient statue of some long-dead civic leader
who had probably never expected to provide cover during an assassination
attempt, drew his sword, and began the sort of tactical assessment that
separated experienced officers from optimistic amateurs.</p><p>One crossbow, fired from the shadows across the street. Professional
quality, expensive quarrels, positioned for a clean shot with multiple
escape routes. The sort of setup that suggested Guild training and
considerable advance planning.</p><p>“Right then,” Vimes called out to the darkness. “Professional
courtesy time. I assume you’re from the Guild of Assassins, and I assume
you know I’m on the Do Not Kill list. So what’s this about?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="141"><p>A figure stepped from the shadows with the sort of fluid grace that
came from years of specialized training in the graceful elimination of
targets. They wore the black clothing favored by people whose profession
required them to be invisible, and they carried themselves with the
confidence that suggested considerable expertise in matters involving
other people’s mortality.</p><p>“Commander Vimes,” the assassin said, their voice carrying the sort
of educated accent that suggested expensive schooling and probably a
degree in Classical Assassination with a minor in Practical Ethics. “I’m
afraid there’s been a… scheduling irregularity.”</p><p>“A what now?”</p><p>“According to our records, you should have died several years ago.
Multiple times, actually. Poison, falling masonry, knife work, an
exploding carriage, that incident with the dragon, the thing with the
vampires, and most notably when you were… displaced in time.”</p><p>Vimes felt a chill that had nothing to do with the evening air. “When
I was Keel.”</p><p>“Yes. Our information suggests you should have died during the
Glorious Revolution. Instead, you somehow… returned. The cosmic
implications have been… significant.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="142"><p>“The Guild has received complaints. You’re creating statistical
anomalies in the mortality tables. Some of our clients are… concerned…
about the disruption to natural order.”</p><p>“Natural order?”</p><p>“Death, Commander. It serves a purpose. When people who are scheduled
to die continue not dying, it affects the cosmic balance. There are
entities who find this… problematic.”</p><p>The pieces clicked together in Vimes’s mind with the sort of clarity
that came from years of police work and recent conversations with
anthropomorphic personifications. “Someone’s hired you to kill me
because I keep not dying when I’m supposed to.”</p><p>“That’s a simplified but essentially accurate assessment.”</p><p>“And you took the contract despite the Do Not Kill list?”</p><p>The assassin shifted slightly, and Vimes caught something that might
have been embarrassment in their posture. “The Guild has been…
pressured… by certain elevated clients. Entities who consider adherence
to scheduling more important than professional courtesy.”</p><p>“Cosmic entities.”</p><p>“I’m not at liberty to discuss the nature of our clientele. But
yes.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="143"><p>It was at this point that Death materialized beside them, but not

BUT…</p><p>“But?” Vimes asked, though he wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to know
the answer.</p><p><span class="death-speech">BUT I CANNOT. THERE IS… SOMETHING… PREVENTING THE TRANSITION.</span></p><p>The assassin looked between Death and Vimes with the expression of
someone whose professional understanding of the universe had just been
significantly complicated.</p><p>“You can’t guide his transition?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">NO. HIS LIFE TIMER CONTINUES TO RUN, BUT SOMETHING IS… INTERFERING…
WITH THE NATURAL PROCESS.</span></p><p>“What sort of something?” Vimes asked.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="144"><p>THAT, Death said grimly, <span class="death-speech">IS WHAT I INTEND TO DISCOVER.</span></p><p>Death reached into his robe and produced Vimes’s hourglass. Instead
of the usual sand, it was filled with what appeared to be cigar smoke,
but the smoke was moving in patterns that defied several fundamental
laws of physics. It swirled with purpose, forming shapes that looked
almost like… protection.</p><p>I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS, Death admitted. <span class="death-speech">SOMETHING IS
ACTIVELY PRESERVING YOUR EXISTENCE AGAINST THE NATURAL ORDER.</span></p><p>“Natural order seems to be having a lot of problems lately,” Vimes
observed.</p><p>The assassin cleared their throat politely. “If Death himself cannot
guide the target’s transition, then the contract is… beyond our
professional scope.”</p><p>INDEED, Death agreed. <span class="death-speech">THIS MATTER REQUIRES… INVESTIGATION.</span></p><p>“Investigation into what?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">INTO WHO OR WHAT HAS THE POWER TO PREVENT DEATH ITSELF.</span> Death’s voice
carried the sort of concern that suggested this was not a routine
occurrence. <span class="death-speech">COMMANDER, YOUR CONTINUED EXISTENCE IS APPARENTLY BEING
MAINTAINED BY FORCES THAT OPERATE OUTSIDE NORMAL COSMIC AUTHORITY.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="145"><p>The assassin bowed politely to both of them. “The Guild will be
suspending all contracts related to Commander Vimes pending… resolution
of these unusual circumstances. This appears to be a matter for cosmic
authorities rather than professional services.”</p><p>They faded back into the shadows just as heavy footsteps announced
the arrival of Sergeant Detritus, who rounded the corner with his
crossbow in hand and a grim expression that suggested he was prepared to
ask questions after shooting things.</p><p>“Commander!” Detritus called out, then stopped and looked around at
the peaceful street scene with evident confusion. “Carrot said dere was
trouble. Where is trouble?”</p><p>“Just missed it, Sergeant,” Vimes said, noting the relief in Death’s
skeletal features. “Professional consultation, you might say.”</p><p>“Hmph.” Detritus looked disappointed. “Dey always run away when I get
here. Very inconsiderate.”</p><p>Death nodded with what might have been approval. <span class="death-speech">SERGEANT DETRITUS.
YOUR TIMING IS… FORTUITOUS.</span></p><p>“Oh, hello Death,” Detritus said with the sort of casual
acknowledgment one professional might offer another. “You here on
business?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">NOT… EXACTLY. THERE APPEAR TO BE… COMPLICATIONS.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="146"><p>This left Vimes with Death and his most reliable backup officer, both
of whom seemed to understand that something significant had just
happened, even if the details remained unclear.</p><p>“So,” Vimes said, lighting a cigar with hands that were steadier than
he felt. “Someone or something is keeping me alive, and you don’t know
who?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">CORRECT. AND THAT, COMMANDER, IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING.</span></p><p>“Because?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY FEW ENTITIES WITH THE POWER TO OVERRIDE DEATH.
AND MOST OF THEM HAVE… QUESTIONABLE MOTIVATIONS.</span></p><p>As they walked through the peaceful streets toward Ramkin Manor,
Vimes reflected that some mysteries were more unsettling than others.
Being protected by Death was one thing. Being protected by something
powerful enough to override Death was quite another.</p><p>Behind them, the crossbow bolt remained embedded in the lamp post
like a question mark punctuating the growing mystery of Sam Vimes’s
impossible survival.</p><p>Some irregularities, it seemed, had irregularities of their own.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.22" id="chapter-15-the-data-trail"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.22</span> Chapter 15: The Data
Trail</h3></div><div class="page" data-page="147"><p>Two days later, Nobby and Colon returned to the Watch House with the
sort of expressions that suggested they had discovered something either
very important or very disturbing. Possibly both. Death was studying
Cheery’s forensic equipment with the sort of professional interest that
suggested he was either learning new investigative techniques or
contemplating career diversification.</p><p>“Commander,” Colon said, setting down a stack of official documents
with the careful reverence usually reserved for evidence in capital
crimes. “You’re going to want to see this.”</p><p>THESE DOCUMENTS SMELL OF BUREAUCRACY, Death observed, leaning closer
to examine the paperwork. <span class="death-speech">AND SOMETHING ELSE. SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTS
THEY WERE CREATED BY ENTITIES THAT DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF
INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE.</span></p><p>The documents were copies of various official records—birth
certificates, death certificates, hospital admissions forms, insurance
claims, and accident reports. They had been organized with the sort of
methodical attention to detail that suggested either excellent police
work or an unhealthy obsession with bureaucratic procedure.</p><p>“What am I looking at?” Vimes asked.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="148"><p>“Requests for information,” Nobby said, consulting his notebook with
uncharacteristic seriousness. “Someone’s been systematically requesting
copies of records related to people who’ve had near-death
experiences.”</p><p>“Someone official?”</p><p>“That’s the thing, Commander. The requests all come from something
called the ‘Quality Assurance Department’ of the ‘Universal Life
Management Corporation.’ Very official-looking paperwork, proper stamps,
all the right forms.”</p><p>Colon produced a sample request form. “They’ve been filing these for
months. Always asking for the same information—people who survived
accidents, difficult births, serious illnesses, anything that should
have been fatal but wasn’t.”</p><p>“And the record keepers just handed over the information?”</p><p>“Proper paperwork, Commander. You know how it is—if the forms are
filled out correctly, nobody asks questions.”</p><p>Vimes studied the request form with growing unease. It was
professionally prepared, complete with official-looking seals and the
sort of elaborate formatting that suggested considerable bureaucratic
expertise. But something about it made his policeman’s instincts
itch.</p><p>“Has anyone heard of the Universal Life Management Corporation?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="149"><p>“That’s what we thought you’d ask,” Nobby said proudly. “So we
checked with the Guild of Merchants and Traders, the Tax Assessment
Office, and the Commercial Registry.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“There’s no such company registered in Ankh-Morpork. Or anywhere
else, according to the trade records.”</p><p>At that moment, Captain Carrot and Sergeant Angua returned from their
hospital canvassing, both of them carrying the sort of expressions that
suggested their investigation had been educational in ways they hadn’t
entirely expected.</p><p>“Commander,” Carrot said, “we need to talk. We’ve found something
disturbing.”</p><p>“More disturbing than a fictional company collecting information
about near-death experiences?”</p><p>“Potentially, yes. The hospitals have been visited by representatives
from the same Quality Assurance Department. They’ve been conducting what
they call ‘efficiency assessments’ of patient survival rates.”</p><p>“Efficiency assessments?”</p><p>“They wanted to know why certain patients survived when medical
projections suggested they shouldn’t have,” Angua explained. “The
hospital staff thought they were from some sort of medical research
organization.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="150"><p>“Did anyone get a good look at these representatives?”</p><p>“That’s the strange part,” Carrot continued. “Everyone remembers them
being very professional, very thorough, but nobody can give a detailed
description. It’s like they were… generically official.”</p><p>Cheery looked up from her chemical analysis equipment. “That fits
with what I’ve discovered about those preservation compounds. They’re
not just supernatural—they’re specifically designed to prevent things
from being remembered clearly. Memory preservation, if you will.”</p><p>“Memory preservation?”</p><p>“Chemicals that ensure witnesses remember seeing someone official and
professional, but can’t recall specific details. It’s very sophisticated
work.”</p><p>Vimes lit a cigar and studied the evidence they’d assembled. A
fictional company collecting information about near-death experiences.
Generic officials conducting efficiency assessments at hospitals. A
professional killer using supernatural preservation compounds to
eliminate people who had survived things they weren’t supposed to
survive.</p><p>“Right then,” he said finally. “This isn’t just murder. This is
someone conducting a systematic campaign to eliminate people who’ve
disrupted… what? Some sort of cosmic schedule?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="151"><p>“It does suggest a rather… elevated… level of organization,” Carrot
agreed.</p><p>“The question is: who has the authority to decide that certain people
aren’t supposed to be alive? And why do they care enough to hire
professional killers to correct the situation?”</p><p>Angua’s nose twitched. “Commander, there’s something else. The scent
trail I’ve been following? It doesn’t just lead to boarding houses and
hotels. It also leads to several government buildings, including the
Post Office and the Tax Assessment Department.”</p><p>“Our killer’s been visiting government offices?”</p><p>“Regularly. As if they were… filing reports. Or receiving
assignments.”</p><p>The pieces of the puzzle were starting to form a picture that Vimes
didn’t like at all. Someone with access to official channels,
supernatural resources, and professional killers was systematically
eliminating people for the crime of not dying when they were supposed
to.</p><p>“I think,” he said grimly, “we need to have a conversation with some
people who understand cosmic scheduling. And I suspect I know who to
ask.”</p><hr/></div><div class="page" data-page="152"><h3 data-number="1.1.23" id="chapter-16-the-municipal-response"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.23</span> Chapter 16: The Municipal
Response</h3><p>The next morning brought an unusual sight: Commander Vimes walking
purposefully toward the Patrician’s Palace with a folder of evidence,
Death walking beside him with the sort of skeletal dignity that
suggested he found municipal politics interesting, and the sort of grim
expression that suggested he was about to make someone’s day
considerably more complicated.</p><p>Lord Vetinari received them in the Oblong Office with the sort of
calm attention that suggested he had been expecting this visit and had
already prepared several responses to whatever Vimes was about to tell
him. He barely glanced at Death, as if anthropomorphic personifications
visiting his office were routine administrative matters.</p><p>“Commander. Death,” Vetinari said with the sort of polite
acknowledgment usually reserved for interdimensional diplomacy. “I trust
your investigation has been… illuminating?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="153"><p>“More than I’d like,” Vimes replied, settling into the chair across
from Vetinari’s desk. “We’re dealing with a systematic campaign to
murder people who’ve survived near-death experiences. Professional
killer, supernatural resources, and what appears to be cosmic
authorization.”</p><p>“Cosmic authorization?”</p><p>Vimes laid out the evidence—the fake company records, the efficiency
assessments, the memory-preserving chemicals, the systematic data
collection. “Someone with access to supernatural resources and official
channels is treating human survival as a quality control problem.”</p><p>Vetinari finally looked up from his document. “And you believe this
represents a threat to municipal stability?”</p><p>“I believe this represents someone treating Ankh-Morpork citizens
like statistical errors that need to be corrected. Which makes it my
problem.”</p><p>“Indeed.” Vetinari stood and moved to his window, looking out over
the city with the expression of someone who found the view both
instructive and concerning. “The question, Commander, is whether this is
a problem that can be solved through conventional law enforcement.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="154"><p>“If, as your evidence suggests, we are dealing with entities that
operate according to cosmic rather than municipal authority, then simply
arresting them may prove… insufficient.”</p><p>Vimes felt a familiar chill. “You know who’s behind this.”</p><p>“I have… suspicions. Based on previous encounters with entities that
value order above existence, efficiency above compassion, and
statistical purity above human life.”</p><p>“The Auditors of Reality?”</p><p>Vetinari turned back to his desk and produced a file that Vimes
hadn’t seen him retrieve. “The Auditors have a long history of…
interventions… when they perceive irregularities in cosmic order.
Usually they work through intermediaries to avoid direct involvement in
messy, unpredictable activities like murder.”</p><p>“So they hire professional killers.”</p><p>“They engage quality control specialists to address statistical
anomalies. The terminology is important to them—they prefer to think of
themselves as maintaining cosmic balance rather than committing
murder.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="155"><p>Vimes studied the file Vetinari had produced. It contained reports of
similar incidents in other cities, other times. Always the same
pattern—people who had survived improbable circumstances, professional
killers with access to supernatural resources, and official-looking
paperwork that justified the murders as necessary corrections.</p><p>“This has happened before?”</p><p>“Regularly. Though usually in smaller communities where the local
authorities lack the resources to investigate properly. Ankh-Morpork
appears to be their first attempt at… large-scale quality control.”</p><p>“And you’ve known about this?”</p><p>“I’ve been… monitoring… the situation. The Auditors tend to operate
according to predictable patterns. They identify irregularities,
authorize corrections, and then move on to other statistical problems.
Usually the process takes several months to complete.”</p><p>Vimes felt his anger rising. “You’ve been monitoring them while they
murder people?”</p><p>“I’ve been gathering evidence, Commander. Evidence that could be used
to challenge their authority under cosmic law. The Auditors may
represent perfect order, but perfect order must follow its own
rules.”</p><p>“What rules?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="156"><p>Vetinari opened the file to a page covered with the sort of dense,
bureaucratic language that suggested considerable legal expertise.
“Cosmic entities operating within municipal boundaries are subject to
local jurisdiction in matters involving the welfare of citizens. It’s an
obscure provision, but it’s legally binding.”</p><p>“You mean I can arrest them?”</p><p>“You can certainly try. Though I suspect the attempt would be more…
educational… than successful. However, there may be another
approach.”</p><p>Vetinari closed the file and looked directly at Vimes. “The Auditors
operate according to bureaucratic principles. They value procedure,
documentation, and proper authority. If we can demonstrate that their
quality control program is itself creating irregularities…”</p><p>“We can force them to stop?”</p><p>“We can present them with a bureaucratic problem that requires their
attention. And bureaucratic problems, Commander, have a way of consuming
enormous amounts of time and resources.”</p><p>Vimes grinned grimly. “You want to bury them in paperwork.”</p><p>“I want to demonstrate that their solution is worse than the problem
they’re trying to solve. Which, based on your evidence, appears to be
the case.”</p><hr/></div><div class="page" data-page="157"><h3 data-number="1.1.24" id="chapter-17-the-case-against-order"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.24</span> Chapter 17: The Case Against
Order</h3><p>That afternoon, the entire Watch worked with the sort of focused
intensity usually reserved for preventing riots or apprehending
particularly dangerous criminals. But instead of chasing suspects
through the city’s more creative neighborhoods, they were building what
Vimes had described as “the most important arrest case in the history of
law enforcement.”</p><p>The main office had been transformed into something that looked like
a cross between a military command center and a very aggressive
accounting firm. Maps covered every available wall surface, marked with
pins indicating murder locations, data collection points, and official
visits. Tables groaned under the weight of documents, witness
statements, and forensic evidence. The air was thick with cigar smoke
and the sort of determined concentration that suggested everyone
understood the stakes.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="158"><p>“Right then,” Vimes said, addressing his assembled officers. “We’re
going to prove that the Auditors’ quality control program is causing
more problems than it solves. Which means we need to document every
irregularity their murders have created.”</p><p>Cheery had prepared a detailed analysis that cut straight to the
heart of the matter. “The preservation compounds contain something that
shouldn’t exist—temporal stabilizers mixed with essence of insurance
fraud. Our killer isn’t just committing murder, they’re profiting from
it through an elaborate scheme involving cosmic scheduling and actuarial
manipulation.”</p><p>“How so?” Carrot asked.</p><p>“They’ve been taking out life insurance policies on people they knew
were scheduled to die, then collecting when Death postponed those
deaths, then murdering the victims and collecting again. Double
compensation for cosmic irregularities.”</p><p>“So they’re profiting from cosmic compassion?”</p><p>“Exactly. And the Auditors have been paying them additional fees for
‘quality control services.’ It’s cosmic fraud on an interdimensional
scale.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="159"><p>Sergeant Angua consulted her tracking notes. “The scent analysis
confirms that our killer has been active for months, possibly years. But
the chemical signature has been getting stronger recently, which
suggests either escalation or desperation.”</p><p>“Escalation?”</p><p>“They’re using more powerful preservation compounds for each murder.
Either the irregularities are getting harder to eliminate, or the
Auditors are getting impatient with the pace of corrections.”</p><p>Nobby had prepared what he proudly called “a comprehensive analysis
of bureaucratic irregularities and insurance fraud,” which connected the
cosmic murders to a very earthly motive.</p><p>“The fake company paperwork isn’t just about hiding murders,” he
reported. “It’s about money. Lots of money. Our killer has been filing
insurance claims through seventeen different companies, collecting death
benefits on people they knew would survive their scheduled deaths, then
killing them and collecting survivor benefits too.”</p><p>“How much money are we talking about?”</p><p>“Over fifty thousand dollars so far. And that’s just what I can
trace. The Universal Life Management Corporation was a front for the
biggest insurance fraud scheme in the city’s history.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="160"><p>Sergeant Colon had cross-referenced the murder victims with city
records and discovered something disturbing. “Commander, the people who
were killed weren’t just random survivors. They were all… productive
members of society. Sarah was a skilled seamstress, Thomas was a
reliable carriage driver, Margaret did charity work, Marcus was solving
insurance fraud cases.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So their deaths have created secondary problems. Sarah’s baby needs
care, Thomas’s regular passengers have lost reliable transportation,
Margaret’s charity work has stopped, Marcus’s cases have gone unsolved.
The Auditors haven’t just killed four people—they’ve disrupted dozens of
lives.”</p><p>Captain Carrot had prepared the most comprehensive analysis,
combining all their findings into what he called “a formal assessment of
cosmic quality control effectiveness.”</p><p>“The data shows that the Auditors’ correction program has generated
significantly more irregularities than it has eliminated,” he reported.
“Each murder has created ripple effects that have disrupted established
patterns of social and economic activity.”</p><p>“Give me specifics.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="161"><p>“Sarah’s death left her baby orphaned, requiring intervention by
municipal child welfare services. Thomas’s death created transportation
disruptions that affected seventeen regular customers and three local
businesses. Margaret’s death stopped charitable activities that were
providing assistance to forty-three impoverished families. Marcus’s
death left twelve active fraud cases unresolved, representing potential
losses of over eight thousand dollars.”</p><p>“And the cosmic scarring Cheery mentioned?”</p><p>“Is accumulating faster than natural processes can repair it. At
current rates, we’re looking at significant reality distortion within
six months.”</p><p>Vimes studied the compiled evidence with growing satisfaction. It was
the sort of comprehensive case that would make even cosmic entities
think twice about their methodology.</p><p>“So,” he said finally, “the Auditors’ quality control program is
causing more chaos than the irregularities they’re trying to
correct?”</p><p>“Significantly more,” Carrot confirmed. “Their solution is
demonstrably worse than the problem.”</p><p>“Right then. Time to file some complaints.”</p><hr/></div><div class="page" data-page="162"><h3 data-number="1.1.25" id="chapter-18-the-direct-approach"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.25</span> Chapter 18: The Direct
Approach</h3><p>The next morning, Vimes did something that few people in the history
of the Disc had ever attempted: he filed a formal complaint against
cosmic entities.</p><p>“Right then,” he said, setting down his pen in the Watch House with
the sort of finality that suggested he had just completed a task that
would either solve everything or make everything considerably worse.
“That should get their attention.”</p><p>The document spread across his desk was three pages of official City
Watch letterhead, complete with seals, signatures, and the sort of
aggressive bureaucratic language that Vimes had learned from watching
Lord Vetinari handle interdimensional diplomacy. The complaint was
addressed to “The Auditors of Reality, or whoever is currently
responsible for cosmic order and the unauthorized murder of Ankh-Morpork
citizens.”</p><p>Captain Carrot read over his shoulder. “Commander, are you sure about
this approach?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="163"><p>“Carrot, they sent an assassin after me because I’m an irregularity
in their filing system. They hired a killer to murder innocent people
for surviving near-death experiences. They treat human lives like
accounting errors.” Vimes lit a cigar with more force than was strictly
necessary. “I’m not hiding from cosmic bureaucrats. If they want to
discuss my continued existence, they can make an appointment like
everyone else.”</p><p>“But what if they actually respond?”</p><p>“Then we’ll find out what they want, and we’ll negotiate. Same as we
do with the Guilds when they get ideas above their station.”</p><p>“The Guilds are human, Commander.”</p><p>“The Auditors are bureaucrats. Trust me, Carrot - the species doesn’t
matter. All bureaucrats think the same way: they want everything to be
neat, predictable, and properly documented. The trick is making your
position seem more bureaucratically sound than theirs.”</p><p>As if summoned by the mention of bureaucratic procedure, the
temperature in the room dropped several degrees. The gas lamps
flickered, and the air took on the sort of oppressive quality that
suggested cosmic entities with strong opinions about paperwork were
materializing nearby.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="164"><p>Three figures appeared in the center of the office - gray,
featureless, and radiating the sort of absolute authority that came from
beings who had never been told they were wrong about anything. They wore
robes that were less clothing than the absence of color, and they stood
in perfectly geometric formation as if someone had arranged them with a
mathematical compass.</p><p>“COMMANDER VIMES,” said the first Auditor, its voice carrying the
sort of precision that suggested each word had been checked against
seventeen different dictionaries. “<span class="death-speech">YOU HAVE SUBMITTED A FORMAL COMPLAINT
REGARDING COSMIC ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.</span>”</p><p>“That’s right,” Vimes said, standing up but not backing down. Years
of dealing with Lord Vetinari had taught him that showing weakness to
cosmic authority figures was a mistake you only made once. “Murder of
Ankh-Morpork citizens is a crime under municipal law. I don’t care who
authorized it.”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE SCHEDULED FOR TERMINATION. THEIR CONTINUED
EXISTENCE REPRESENTED VIOLATIONS OF COSMIC ORDER.</span>”</p><p>“So you hired someone to kill them.”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">WE IMPLEMENTED NECESSARY CORRECTIONS TO MAINTAIN UNIVERSAL
STABILITY.</span>”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="165"><p>Vimes took a long drag on his cigar, noting how the smoke seemed to
swirl in patterns that defied the usual laws of air circulation. “Right.
Well, under municipal law, that’s called conspiracy to commit murder.
You’re under arrest.”</p><p>The silence that followed this statement was the sort of quiet that
preceded either cosmic enlightenment or universal catastrophe.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">YOU CANNOT ARREST COSMIC ENTITIES,</span>” said the second Auditor, though
its voice carried a note of what might have been uncertainty.</p><p>“Watch me.” Vimes gestured to Carrot, who produced handcuffs with the
sort of professional efficiency that suggested he had been expecting
this moment. “You have the right to remain silent, though I suspect
you’re not capable of remaining anything else. You have the right to
representation, though I’m not sure what lawyer would take a case
involving the fundamental nature of reality.”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED,</span>” declared the third Auditor.</p><p>“So is hiring assassins to kill people for surviving disasters.
Unprecedented doesn’t mean illegal.” Vimes studied the three entities
with the sort of professional attention he usually reserved for
examining evidence. “The question is: are you going to come quietly, or
do I need to call in the special circumstances team?”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES TEAM?</span>”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="166"><p>“Sergeant Angua handles supernatural suspects. Constable Igor is very
good with entities that don’t follow normal physical laws. And Captain
Carrot here has experience with beings who think they’re above municipal
authority.”</p><p>The Auditors consulted among themselves in the sort of rapid,
whispered conference that cosmic entities used when their universal
certainty encountered local law enforcement.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORITY OF MUNICIPAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.</span>”</p><p>“And I don’t recognize the authority of cosmic filing clerks to
murder my citizens. Seems like we have a jurisdictional dispute.” Vimes
moved closer, noting how the Auditors seemed to recoil slightly from his
presence. “Here’s the thing about jurisdiction - it belongs to whoever’s
willing to enforce it. And I’m willing to enforce municipal law against
anyone who breaks it, up to and including anthropomorphic
personifications of universal order.”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">YOU ARE ONE INDIVIDUAL. WE REPRESENT COSMIC AUTHORITY.</span>”</p><p>“I represent the people of Ankh-Morpork. And the people of
Ankh-Morpork don’t like it when cosmic entities murder their neighbors
for the crime of not dying on schedule.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="167"><p>Carrot stepped forward with his handcuffs. “You have the right to a
trial by jury of your peers, though finding cosmic entities willing to
serve on a jury might be challenging.”</p><p>“STOP,” said the first Auditor, and the word carried enough authority
to make the gas lamps flicker. “<span class="death-speech">THIS… DISCUSSION… IS BECOMING
IRREGULAR.</span>”</p><p>“Too right it’s irregular. Murder usually is.” Vimes crossed his
arms. “So what’s it going to be? Are you going to stop hiring killers to
murder people for surviving near-death experiences, or are we going to
have a very interesting conversation about extradition treaties between
Ankh-Morpork and wherever it is you file your paperwork?”</p><p>The Auditors huddled together in what might have been panic, if
cosmic entities were capable of emotions that disorderly.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">WE… REQUIRE… CONSULTATION,</span>” admitted the second Auditor
reluctantly.</p><p>“With who?”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">ENTITIES OF HIGHER AUTHORITY. THIS SITUATION HAS… ESCALATED… BEYOND
NORMAL PARAMETERS.</span>”</p><p>“Right then. You’ve got twenty-four hours to produce either a higher
authority willing to negotiate, or evidence that you’ve stopped hiring
assassins. After that, I’m issuing warrants for cosmic conspiracy, and
we’ll let the courts sort out jurisdiction.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="168"><p>“<span class="death-speech">YOU CANNOT</span>—”</p><p>“I just did.” Vimes sat back down at his desk and picked up his pen.
“Captain Carrot, please escort these entities off the premises. And
remind them that interfering with a police investigation is also illegal
under municipal law.”</p><p>The door to the office opened and Sergeant Detritus entered, taking
in the scene with the sort of professional assessment that came from
years of backup work. He looked at the three gray figures, at Vimes
behind his desk, and at Carrot standing ready with handcuffs.</p><p>“Dese are de entities dat been causing trouble?” Detritus asked,
studying the Auditors with interest. “Dey not very impressive. I thought
cosmic beings would be bigger.”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">WHAT IS THAT?</span>” asked the first Auditor, apparently noticing Detritus
for the first time.</p><p>“Sergeant Detritus, City Watch,” Detritus replied helpfully. “I
specialize in difficult arrests and entities dat think dey are too
important for municipal law.”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">A TROLL?</span>” The second Auditor seemed genuinely surprised.</p><p>“Very observant,” Vimes said dryly. “Now, as I was saying—”</p><p>“WAIT,” said the third Auditor. “<span class="death-speech">TROLLS ARE… MATHEMATICAL. THEY
UNDERSTAND PROPER ORDER.</span>”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="169"><p>Detritus considered this statement. “Dat true. I understand order
very well. Dat why I know when someone is being disorderly.” He gestured
at the Auditors. “You been hiring killers to murder people. Dat very
disorderly.”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">WE WERE RESTORING COSMIC BALANCE.</span>”</p><p>“By committing crimes,” Detritus said with the sort of blunt logic
that made cosmic philosophy suddenly seem very simple. “Dat not balance.
Dat just crime with fancy excuses.”</p><p>The door opened again and Constable Reg Shoe entered, still carrying
his notebook and looking slightly out of breath despite technically not
needing to breathe.</p><p>“Sorry I’m late, Commander. I was filing the incident reports from—”
He stopped and stared at the three gray figures. “Oh. Are these the
entities that have been causing all the trouble?”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">WHAT IS THIS?</span>” demanded the first Auditor, apparently even more
disturbed by Reg’s presence than they had been by Detritus.</p><p>“Constable Reg Shoe, Ankh-Morpork City Watch,” Reg replied with
professional courtesy. “I understand you’ve been hiring people to kill
citizens who didn’t die when you thought they should?”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">THAT ENTITY IS ALREADY DEAD,</span>” said the second Auditor, its voice
carrying a note of cosmic confusion.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="170"><p>“Yes, well spotted,” Reg said cheerfully. “I died several years ago
on the barricades during the revolution. Very noble cause. But the thing
is, I’m still here, still doing my job, still serving the public. Funny
how that works, isn’t it?”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. THE DEAD SHOULD REMAIN DEAD.</span>”</p><p>“Says who?” Reg consulted his notebook. “I’ve checked the
regulations, and there’s nothing in municipal law that says being dead
disqualifies you from public service. In fact, I’d argue that my
continued existence proves that your whole cosmic scheduling system is
rather inflexible.”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">WE ARE THE AUDITORS OF REALITY. WE DEFINE WHAT IS POSSIBLE.</span>”</p><p>“Well, you’re doing a terrible job of it,” Reg said with the sort of
professional criticism that civil servants reserved for poorly managed
departments. “If dead people can keep working, and living people can
survive past their scheduled termination dates, then maybe your system
needs updating rather than enforcement through murder.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="171"><p>As the Auditors faded back into whatever dimension they came
from—apparently having discovered that cosmic authority was somewhat
less impressive when confronted by a troll with a clear understanding of
right and wrong and a zombie with strong opinions about administrative
competence—Carrot turned to Vimes with the sort of expression that
suggested either admiration or concern for his commander’s mental
health.</p><p>“Commander, do you think that was wise?”</p><p>“Probably not. But it was necessary.” Vimes returned to his
paperwork. “Sometimes the only way to deal with bullies is to stand up
to them. Even cosmic bullies.”</p><p>“And if they come back with something worse than assassins?”</p><p>Vimes smiled grimly. “Then we’ll find out just how far municipal
authority extends into cosmic jurisdiction. Should be educational.”</p><p>As Carrot and Detritus headed out to file their reports, Reg lingered
behind, still studying his notes with the sort of professional interest
that suggested he was working out the implications of what they’d just
witnessed.</p><p>“Commander,” he said thoughtfully, “can I ask you something? About
all this cosmic scheduling business?”</p><p>“Go ahead, Reg.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="172"><p>“Well, it’s just that I’ve been thinking about what those Auditors
said. About people staying dead when they’re supposed to.” Reg consulted
his notebook. “The thing is, I died when I was supposed to. Very
definitely dead. Properly scheduled and everything. But here I am.”</p><p>At that moment, Death materialized in the chair across from Vimes’s
desk, appearing with the sort of casual precision that suggested he had
been listening to the conversation and had decided it required his
input.</p><p>“Death,” Vimes acknowledged. “Perfect timing.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">INDEED.</span> Death studied Reg with interest. <span class="death-speech">CONSTABLE SHOE. I HAVE BEEN
MEANING TO SPEAK WITH YOU.</span></p><p>“Oh. Er. Hello, Death,” Reg said, suddenly looking uncertain. “I hope
there isn’t a problem with my… status?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">QUITE THE OPPOSITE. I FIND YOUR CONTINUED EXISTENCE…
ILLUMINATING.</span></p><p>“Do you?” Reg perked up. “Because I’ve been wondering about the
mechanics myself. I mean, I went through the whole dying process—very
thorough, you were—but then I just… came back.”</p><p>Death turned to Vimes. <span class="death-speech">COMMANDER, YOU ASKED EARLIER ABOUT THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SITUATION AND THAT OF CONSTABLE SHOE.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="173"><p>“I was wondering about that,” Vimes said, lighting a cigar. “You
can’t guide my transition because of some cosmic irregularity involving
friendship and tobacco smoke. But Reg here died properly and just…
refused to stay transitioned.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">PRECISELY. THE DIFFERENCES ARE… SIGNIFICANT.</span> Death gestured to both
of them. YOU, COMMANDER, APPEAR TO BE PROTECTED BY EXTERNAL FORCES—<span class="death-speech">MY
OWN RELUCTANCE TO COMPLETE THE TRANSITION, PERHAPS COMBINED WITH OTHER
INFLUENCES WE DO NOT YET UNDERSTAND.</span></p><p>“And me?” Reg asked, leaning forward with interest.</p><p>CONSTABLE SHOE… Death paused, studying Reg with the sort of attention
usually reserved for particularly complex cosmic equations. <span class="death-speech">YOU SIMPLY
REFUSED TO ACCEPT DEATH AS FINAL.</span></p><p>“Refused?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">WHEN I GUIDED YOUR TRANSITION, YOU WENT THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS.</span>
YOU EXPERIENCED DEATH FULLY—<span class="death-speech">THE CESSATION OF BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION, THE
SEPARATION OF SOUL FROM BODY, THE TRANSITION TO… WHATEVER COMES NEXT.</span>
BUT THEN…</p><p>“Then what?”</p><p>THEN YOU LOOKED AROUND, DECIDED THE AFTERLIFE WASN’<span class="death-speech">T FOR YOU, AND
CAME BACK.</span> Death’s tone carried what might have been admiration. <span class="death-speech">I HAVE
NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="174"><p>“Really?” Reg seemed pleased. “I just remember thinking that I had
work to finish. People depending on me. Rights to defend.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">MOST PEOPLE, WHEN THEY DIE, ACCEPT IT. THEY MOVE ON TO WHATEVER
AWAITS THEM. YOU… SIMPLY REFUSED TO GO.</span></p><p>“Refused?” Reg looked puzzled. “Well, yes, I suppose that’s accurate.
I remember you arriving, very professional service, and I just… didn’t
go with you.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">YOU WALKED AWAY.</span></p><p>“I had work to finish! People depending on me. I wasn’t ready to stop
being useful.” Reg consulted his notebook. “I suppose I was rather rude
about it, wasn’t I? Just told you I’d catch up later and went back to my
civic duties.”</p><p>Death turned to Vimes. <span class="death-speech">I GUIDED HIS TRANSITION. PROPERLY. ACCORDING
TO SCHEDULE. BUT HE… REMAINED.</span></p><p>“So you don’t actually… process zombies?” Vimes asked.</p><p><span class="death-speech">NO. THEY APPEAR TO… BYPASS… THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.</span> Death’s voice carried
a note of professional confusion. <span class="death-speech">I GUIDE THEIR TRANSITIONS, BUT THEY DO
NOT… STAY TRANSITIONED.</span></p><p>“Oh, we don’t go through any official channels,” Reg said cheerfully.
“We just refuse to accept death as final. Very simple, really. Bit of
personal determination, strong sense of duty, and Bob’s your uncle -
still working despite being technically deceased.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="175"><p>“Also,” Reg added thoughtfully, “I’m not the only one, you know.”</p><p>“The only what?” Vimes asked.</p><p>“Zombie. There’s Mrs. Cake’s neighbor - comes back every few months
when his pension’s due. Fellow who runs the night shift at the post
office - very dedicated to postal service. Lady who tends the memorial
garden in Small Gods Cemetery - says someone needs to keep it
proper.”</p><p>Death went very still. <span class="death-speech">THERE ARE… OTHERS?</span></p><p>“Oh yes. Quite a few, actually. We don’t really organize or anything
- bit hard to schedule meetings when some of us only turn up seasonally
- but word gets around.” Reg consulted his notebook. “Last I counted,
there were at least two dozen of us just in the city. But that’s only
the ones I know personally.”</p><p>“How many do you think there are… everywhere?” Vimes asked, though he
suspected he wasn’t going to like the answer.</p><p>“Well, if you extrapolate across the entire Disc…” Reg did some quick
calculations. “Hundreds, certainly. Possibly thousands. I mean, every
city has people with unfinished business. Every village has someone who
just can’t let go of their responsibilities.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">AND THEY ALL… REFUSE TO STAY TRANSITIONED?</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="176"><p>“Pretty much. We all get our transitions guided properly - you do
excellent work, very thorough - but then we just… come back. No
paperwork required.”</p><p>Death was quiet for a very long moment. <span class="death-speech">HUNDREDS… POSSIBLY THOUSANDS…
OF PEOPLE WHO BYPASS DEATH ENTIRELY.</span></p><p>“Well, we don’t bypass it exactly,” Reg corrected. “We experience it
fully. It’s just that we don’t consider it… binding.”</p><p>Vimes whistled low. “So there are thousands of people who’ve
discovered they can just… ignore cosmic authority through sheer
bloody-mindedness.”</p><p>I… Death paused, apparently trying to process this information. <span class="death-speech">I HAD
NO IDEA SO MANY PEOPLE COULD SIMPLY… REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH THE COSMIC
ORDER.</span></p><p>“Oh, it’s not about refusing to cooperate,” Reg said earnestly.
“We’re very cooperative. We die when we’re supposed to, we go through
the proper process, we just happen to have continuing obligations that
require our attention.”</p><p>THE AUDITORS… Death’s voice carried something approaching panic. <span class="death-speech">THEY
MUST BE… HORRIFIED.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="177"><p>“Why? We’re not breaking any rules. There’s nothing in the cosmic
regulations that says you can’t come back if you have important work to
finish.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THERE… ISN</span>’T?</p><p>“Not that I’ve found. I’ve checked quite thoroughly. Death is
mandatory, but staying dead appears to be… optional.”</p><p>I… Death paused, apparently trying to process this information. <span class="death-speech">I WAS
SIMPLY… PROCESSING PAPERWORK… AS SUBMITTED.</span></p><p>“Very thoroughly, too,” Reg said approvingly. “Always got a response
within a reasonable timeframe. Much more efficient than most government
departments.”</p><p>Death sighed. <span class="death-speech">I WAS AFRAID YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.</span></p><p>“So,” Vimes said slowly, “you’re telling me that I can’t die because
cosmic forces are keeping me alive, while Reg can’t stay dead because
he’s too stubborn to accept it?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THAT IS… ESSENTIALLY ACCURATE.</span></p><p>“And this doesn’t strike you as a problem with the cosmic
system?”</p><p>COMMANDER, Death said wearily, <span class="death-speech">I AM BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT THE
COSMIC SYSTEM HAS A GREAT MANY PROBLEMS. RIGID SCHEDULING APPEARS TO BE
ONLY ONE OF THEM.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="178"><p>Reg raised his hand. “If I may, Death, I think the real issue is
flexibility. The Auditors want everything to follow exact schedules, but
life—and death—are more complicated than that.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">HOW SO?</span></p><p>“Well, look at it this way. I died on the barricades fighting for the
people. That was important to me. More important than staying dead, as
it turned out. The Commander here does important work protecting the
city. Work that apparently transcends normal mortality schedules.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">CONTINUE.</span></p><p>“Maybe the problem isn’t that people aren’t dying when they’re
supposed to. Maybe the problem is that the schedule isn’t accounting for
what people actually need to accomplish.” Reg consulted his notebook.
“Has anyone ever asked Death what he thinks about the cosmic
schedule?”</p><p>“Good point,” Vimes said. “Death, do you think the schedule is…
accurate?”</p><p>Death was quiet for a long moment. <span class="death-speech">I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE SCHEDULE
FOR MILLENNIA.</span> BUT RECENTLY… His voice trailed off.</p><p>“Recently what?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">RECENTLY I HAVE BEGUN TO NOTICE THAT SOME DEATHS SEEM… PREMATURE.
UNNECESSARY. CRUEL.</span></p><p>“Like Sarah Palmley,” Vimes said quietly.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="179"><p><span class="death-speech">YES. A YOUNG MOTHER, JUST AFTER GIVING BIRTH. THE TIMING SEEMED…
INAPPROPRIATE.</span></p><p>“So you delayed it.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">YES. AND THOMAS KEEL, ON HIS WAY TO A FAMILY CELEBRATION. AND
MARGARET DOWDY, JUST AS SHE WAS RECOVERING FROM A LONG ILLNESS.</span></p><p>“Because it felt wrong.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">PRECISELY.</span> Death looked at his hands. <span class="death-speech">I APPEAR TO HAVE DEVELOPED…
OPINIONS… ABOUT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF CERTAIN DEATHS.</span></p><p>“That’s not a problem,” Reg said firmly. “That’s progress. You’re
developing moral judgment.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">MORAL JUDGMENT IS NOT PART OF MY JOB DESCRIPTION.</span></p><p>“Maybe it should be,” Vimes suggested. “Maybe Death shouldn’t be just
about following schedules. Maybe it should be about… appropriateness.
Dignity. Meaning.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I… HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THAT POSSIBILITY.</span></p><p>“Well,” Reg said, “speaking as someone who’s experienced both death
and the bureaucracy involved in refusing it, I’d say the system could
use some reform.”</p><p>Death studied both of them—a police commander who couldn’t die and a
constable who wouldn’t stay dead. <span class="death-speech">YOU ARE BOTH… IRREGULARITIES.</span></p><p>“The best kind,” Vimes said, taking a satisfied puff of his cigar.
“The kind that prove the system needs fixing.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="180"><p>PERHAPS, Death said thoughtfully, <span class="death-speech">THE AUDITORS ARE WRONG. PERHAPS
IRREGULARITIES ARE NOT ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED. PERHAPS THEY ARE…
IMPROVEMENTS.</span></p><p>“Now you’re thinking like a copper,” Vimes said approvingly.</p><p>As Death faded away, leaving behind only the scent of desert winds
and the faint sound of cosmic bureaucracy being quietly revolutionized,
Reg looked up from his notebook.</p><p>“Well,” he said cheerfully, “that was illuminating. I should probably
write a report.”</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>“Death developing a conscience. I suspect that’s going to have some
interesting implications for municipal policy.”</p><p>Vimes laughed. “Reg, in this job, everything has implications for
municipal policy. File it under ‘Cosmic Administrative Reform’ and we’ll
sort it out later.”</p><p>“Right you are, Commander.”</p><p>As Reg headed out to file what was probably the strangest incident
report in the Watch’s history, Vimes reflected that some conversations
changed everything. Death was developing moral judgment, zombies were
filing bureaucratic complaints about their death status, and cosmic
entities were learning that municipal law enforcement was more
complicated than they’d anticipated.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="181"><p>It was, he thought, probably the most productive day the Watch had
ever had.</p><p>Outside, the city of Ankh-Morpork continued its eternal business of
being complicated and morally ambiguous, but somewhere in the spaces
between dimensions, cosmic entities were learning that some local
authorities took their responsibilities very seriously indeed.</p><p>The universe, Vimes reflected, was about to become considerably more
interesting.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.26" id="chapter-21-the-problem"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.26</span> Chapter 21: The Problem</h3><p>After what had been a particularly long day of municipal
complications and criminal creativity, Vimes couldn’t stand it anymore.
The Watch House had settled into its usual nighttime quiet—the sort of
institutional calm that came when the day shift had gone home and the
night shift hadn’t yet encountered anything that required immediate
paperwork. The building creaked gently as it cooled, making the sort of
noises that suggested either natural thermal contraction or possibly the
presence of very large mice with architectural ambitions.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="182"><p>His office, lit by the warm glow of gas lamps and the occasional
flicker of light from the fireplace, had taken on the comfortable
shabbiness that came with years of being used as both workplace and
occasional refuge. The walls were lined with filing cabinets that had
given up any pretense of organization, bookshelves that contained
everything from law books to treatises on criminal psychology to what
appeared to be a complete collection of municipal regulations dating
back to the founding of the city, and the accumulated detritus of three
decades of police work.</p><p>He cornered Death near the window, where the anthropomorphic
personification had been standing motionless for the better part of an
hour, apparently contemplating the city lights with the sort of
philosophical attention that most people reserved for art galleries or
particularly complex mathematical equations.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="183"><p>“All right,” Vimes said, settling behind his desk with the sort of
determined finality that suggested he was prepared to stay there until
he got satisfactory answers. The chair creaked under his weight—a
familiar sound that had become as much a part of his evening routine as
checking the locks and banking the fire. “Out with it. What’s this
really about? And don’t tell me it’s about persistence or asking
questions or any of that philosophical nonsense. What’s going on?”</p><p>Death turned from the window and sat in the chair across from Vimes’s
desk with the sort of fluid grace that belonged to someone who had never
needed to worry about the normal constraints of joints, muscles, or
basic physics. For a moment, the only sound in the room was the gentle
ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece and the distant sounds of the
city continuing its eternal business of being complicated and morally
ambiguous.</p><p>When Death spoke, his voice carried an odd note of what might have
been uncertainty—a quality that was somehow more unsettling than
confidence would have been.</p><p><span class="death-speech">I HAVE A… PROBLEM. OR RATHER, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.</span></p><p>“What sort of problem?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="184"><p>Death reached into his robe with the sort of careful deliberation
that suggested he was handling something both precious and problematic,
and produced what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary hourglass. Except
that ordinary hourglasses didn’t usually glow with their own inner
light, and they certainly didn’t contain what looked suspiciously like
cigar smoke, lazily drifting from the top chamber to the bottom chamber
and back again in a continuous loop that defied several fundamental laws
of physics.</p><p>The hourglass itself was beautiful in the way that functional objects
sometimes achieved when crafted by someone who understood both form and
purpose. The glass was clear as crystal, the frame was worked in what
appeared to be silver or possibly some metal that didn’t exist in normal
reality, and the whole thing hummed with the sort of barely audible
energy that suggested it was connected to forces considerably more
significant than local gravity.</p><p>YOUR LIFE TIMER, Death explained, setting the hourglass carefully on
Vimes’s desk where it continued to glow with gentle persistence.
<span class="death-speech">EVERYONE HAS ONE. WHEN THE SAND RUNS OUT, THAT IS WHEN I… ARRIVE. IT IS
A VERY EFFICIENT SYSTEM, GENERALLY SPEAKING. OR RATHER, IT WAS.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="185"><p>“Right. And mine is full of…?” Vimes leaned forward, studying the
swirling contents with the sort of professional interest he usually
reserved for particularly puzzling evidence.</p><p><span class="death-speech">CIGAR SMOKE.</span> Death’s tone carried the sort of cosmic confusion that
suggested someone who had discovered that fundamental constants weren’t
as constant as advertised. <span class="death-speech">BUT HERE IS THE TRULY DISTURBING PART - I AM
NOT CERTAIN WHEN IT CHANGED.</span></p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>I MEAN… Death paused, studying the hourglass with the intensity of
someone contemplating a philosophical paradox that might have practical
implications for the stability of reality. <span class="death-speech">UNTIL I LOOKED AT IT
DIRECTLY, I ASSUMED IT CONTAINED SAND LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. IT WAS ONLY
WHEN I EXAMINED IT CLOSELY THAT I DISCOVERED… THIS.</span></p><p>“So it might have always been like this?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">OR IT MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THE MOMENT I OBSERVED IT. THERE IS A
PRINCIPLE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY ABOUT THE ACT OF
OBSERVATION AFFECTING THE THING BEING OBSERVED.</span> Death’s voice carried
the sort of uncertainty that suggested he was venturing into territory
that made even cosmic entities nervous. <span class="death-speech">I HAVE CREATED WHAT SOME MIGHT
CALL… A TEMPORAL PARADOX.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="186"><p>Death paused, studying the hourglass with the intensity of someone
trying to solve a cosmic equation.</p><p><span class="death-speech">I HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THIS… ANOMALY…
BEGAN. AND I BELIEVE I HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL KEY INCIDENTS.</span></p><p>“Go on.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THE FIRST MAJOR IRREGULARITY OCCURRED DURING THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION.
WHEN YOU WENT BACK IN TIME AND BECAME SERGEANT KEEL.</span> Death’s voice
carried the sort of careful attention that suggested he was reciting
facts that still didn’t quite make sense to him.</p><p>“Right. That was… complicated.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED THEN. IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS. THE BARRICADES,
THE FIGHTING, THE UNPEOPLE… BUT SOMETHING PRESERVED YOU. ALLOWED YOU TO
COMPLETE YOUR MISSION AND RETURN TO YOUR PROPER TIME.</span> Death paused,
studying the swirling patterns in the hourglass. <span class="death-speech">BUT THAT IS NOT THE
MOST INTERESTING PART.</span></p><p>“It isn’t?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THE SAME PROTECTION EXTENDED TO YOUR YOUNGER SELF. THE YOUNG WATCHMAN
VIMES WHO WAS ALREADY THERE. HE SHOULD HAVE DIED SEVERAL TIMES DURING
THOSE EVENTS AS WELL - AT THE BARRICADES, DURING THE FIGHTING, WHEN THE
UNPEOPLE CAME. BUT HE SURVIVED. BOTH VERSIONS OF YOU, EXISTING IN THE
SAME TIME, BOTH PROTECTED BY THE SAME… INFLUENCE.</span></p><p>“I thought that was just… the way time worked.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="187"><p><span class="death-speech">NORMALLY, TIME DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. NORMALLY, WHEN SOMEONE IS
DISPLACED IN TIME, THEY EITHER ADAPT TO THEIR NEW CIRCUMSTANCES OR DIE.
THEY DO NOT RETURN TO CREATE STABLE LOOPS. AND THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT
RECEIVE PROTECTION THAT EXTENDS TO OTHER VERSIONS OF THEMSELVES.</span> Death
turned the hourglass slowly, watching the smoke patterns shift. <span class="death-speech">WHATEVER
IS PRESERVING YOU HAS BEEN… COMPREHENSIVE… IN ITS APPROACH.</span></p><p><span class="death-speech">THE SECOND MAJOR INCIDENT INVOLVED THE TIME MONKS. WHEN HISTORY WAS…
ADJUSTED… BY THE AUDITORS.</span></p><p>“When everything stopped for a day that never happened.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">PRECISELY. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ERASED ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE.
INSTEAD, YOU SOMEHOW MAINTAINED YOUR EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THE NORMAL FLOW
OF TIME. EVEN THE HISTORY MONKS FOUND THIS… REMARKABLE.</span></p><p>Vimes took a drag on his cigar, noting how the smoke seemed to echo
the patterns in the hourglass. “And you think these incidents are
connected?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I BELIEVE SOMETHING HAS BEEN… PROTECTING YOU… FOR LONGER THAN EITHER
OF US REALIZED.</span> Death leaned forward. <span class="death-speech">COMMANDER, I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE

THREATS, BUT FROM ACCIDENTS, DISEASES, RANDOM MISFORTUNES.</span></p><p>“But I didn’t.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="188"><p><span class="death-speech">NO. AND THE PATTERN APPEARS TO BE… ACCELERATING. YOUR CONTINUED
EXISTENCE IS HAVING EFFECTS BEYOND THE MERELY PERSONAL.</span></p><p>“What sort of effects?”</p><p>Death gestured toward the window, beyond which the city of
Ankh-Morpork continued its eternal business of being complicated and
morally ambiguous.</p><p><span class="death-speech">YOUR GARDEN, FOR INSTANCE.</span> LADY SYBIL’<span class="death-speech">S ROSES HAVE BEEN BLOOMING OUT

uncertainly. <span class="death-speech">THE CAUSALITY IS UNCLEAR. THE SOIL ITSELF HAS BEEN…
ENHANCED… BY THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHING THAT DEFIES NATURAL DECAY.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="189"><p>Vimes stared at the hourglass, transfixed by the hypnotic movement
within. The smoke swirled and eddied with a life of its own,
occasionally forming what might have been tiny figures engaged in what
might have been arrests, paperwork, or possibly small-scale
philosophical debates. Sometimes the patterns looked like miniature
street scenes, complete with crowds and buildings and what appeared to
be very small horses. Other times, they suggested abstract
concepts—duty, perhaps, or justice, or the sort of stubborn
determination that kept people working long after common sense suggested
they should go home.</p><p>“How long has it been like this?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THAT IS THE PROBLEM.</span> Death’s voice carried the sort of uncertainty
that cosmic entities weren’t supposed to experience. <span class="death-speech">I CANNOT BE
CERTAIN. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE THIS FOR TEN YEARS, SINCE YOU BECAME
COMMANDER. OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NORMAL UNTIL THE MOMENT I DECIDED TO
EXAMINE IT CLOSELY.</span></p><p>“You mean like that thing with the cat in the box?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="190"><p><span class="death-speech">PRECISELY. UNTIL OBSERVED, THE HOURGLASS EXISTED IN A STATE OF…

business of being complicated and morally ambiguous, but inside the
Watch House, something fundamental was shifting.</p><p>“Death,” Vimes said carefully, “are you telling me that you’ve been
following me around because you don’t want to do your job?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">IT IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.</span> Death studied the hourglass,
watching the smoke patterns. <span class="death-speech">I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED… FRIENDSHIP…

seemed to echo the patterns in the hourglass. “You know, Death, I’ve
been thinking about something you said. About asking better
questions.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">YES?</span></p><p>“Well, I’ve been asking myself why someone who should be dead keeps

Properly dead. Multiple times over.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THAT IS… ACCURATE.</span></p><p>“But I’m not. Because you don’t want me to be.” Vimes took a
thoughtful drag. “Which raises an interesting question.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">WHICH IS?</span></p><p>“If Death refuses to guide someone’s transition, are they actually
dead or not?”</p><p>Death considered this with the sort of concentration usually reserved
for cosmic equations. <span class="death-speech">THAT IS… A VERY GOOD QUESTION.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="193"><p>“Because from where I’m sitting, it seems like I might technically be
dead already. Just… not transitioned.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE HOURGLASS.</span></p><p>“Would it?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">CIGARS ARE OFTEN USED TO PRESERVE THINGS. TO PREVENT DECAY.</span> Death
paused. <span class="death-speech">PERHAPS THE SMOKE REPRESENTS… PRESERVATION.</span></p><p>“Preservation of what?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">OF THE FRIENDSHIP WE HAVE BUILT.</span></p><p>Vimes studied his cigar. “So I’m being kept in a kind of… suspended
animation by tobacco smoke and your refusal to do your job?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">IT APPEARS THAT WAY.</span></p><p>“Huh.” Vimes took another puff. “That’s either the most ridiculous
thing I’ve ever heard, or the most touching.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I PREFER TO THINK OF IT AS BOTH.</span></p><p>“Right then.” Vimes stood up. “Well, this explains a lot. Lady Sybil
always said my smoking would be the death of me. Turns out it’s the
opposite.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">IRONY IS A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE UNIVERSE.</span></p><p>“Indeed. So what happens now?”</p><p>NOW? Death also stood. <span class="death-speech">NOW I CONTINUE TO BE YOUR FRIEND. AND YOU

on this particular skull.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="194"><p><span class="death-speech">I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT FRIENDSHIP IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROFESSIONAL

geometry textbook. Her expression suggested that someone was about to
get a lecture.</p><p><span class="death-speech">SUSAN.</span></p><p>“Right. We need to talk.” Susan sat down without being invited and
fixed Death with the sort of stare she usually reserved for students who

three separate gods wanting to know why their worshippers aren’t dying
on schedule, and the Auditors… well, let’s just say they’re taking an
interest. They’re very concerned about causality violations.”</p><p>Death reached into his robe and produced Vimes’s hourglass. <span class="death-speech">I CAN

pets.”</p><p>Death considered this. <span class="death-speech">I HAD NOT CONSIDERED THE BROADER
IMPLICATIONS.</span></p><p>“Of course you hadn’t. You never do.” Susan stood up. “Look, I don’t

have to live in the real world.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?</span></p><p>“Figure it out. Quickly. And try not to break anything important

had never stopped her before.</p><p>Death sat alone, contemplating the hourglass and the growing
realization that his investigation might be creating the very problems
he was trying to solve. The uncertainty was becoming… problematic.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="197"><p>He reached into his robe and produced a small, elegantly wrapped box
of chocolates—Quirm’s finest truffles, the sort that cost more than most
people earned in a month. He placed it carefully on Susan’s desk at the
school, where she would find it after her next lesson on historical
linguistics.</p><p>Some problems, Death reflected, required solutions that he could not
implement directly. Fortunately, he had a granddaughter who specialized
in impossible situations and had never been bound by the same cosmic
restrictions that limited his actions.</p><p>Perhaps it was time to seek advice from someone who understood
temporal mechanics.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.28" id="chapter-23-the-sweeper"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.28</span> Chapter 23: The Sweeper</h3><p>Death materialized in one of those spaces that existed between
moments—a place where time moved like honey and thoughts could stretch
across centuries without rushing. It was the sort of location that
existed at the intersection of several realities, though it appeared to
be nothing more than a simple garden courtyard behind what might have
been a monastery or possibly a very philosophical municipal
building.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="198"><p>The space itself was furnished in the minimalist style favored by
people who understood that the most important things in the universe
were usually invisible. A single stone bench, positioned to overlook a
garden that existed in eternal springtime. Trees that grew in perfect
formation, their leaves moving with breezes that carried the scent of
eternity. A small stream that flowed uphill because it had been designed
by someone who understood that symbolism was more important than
physics.</p><p>Death settled on the bench, contemplating the quantum uncertainties
that were making his existence considerably more complicated than cosmic
entities preferred, when he noticed someone sweeping the path nearby.
The figure moved with the unhurried pace of someone who had learned that
most problems could be solved with appropriate application of time,
attention, and the occasional cup of tea. He carried a broom that looked
perfectly ordinary, though it seemed to be sweeping up things that
weren’t quite visible—temporal debris, perhaps, or the sort of cosmic
lint that accumulated when reality wasn’t properly maintained.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="199"><p>“Afternoon” Lu-Tze said without looking up from his sweeping,
settling into the sort of comfortable conversation that suggested this
meeting was entirely coincidental and not at all the result of certain
individuals keeping an eye on cosmic irregularities. “Nice day for
contemplating chronological paradoxes, isn’t it?”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">LU-TZE.</span>” Death realized he shouldn’t have been surprised to
encounter the Sweeper here—Lu-Tze had a talent for being exactly where
interesting temporal events were unfolding. “<span class="death-speech">I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO
ENCOUNTER ANYONE.</span>”</p><p>“Oh, I’m just doing a bit of maintenance work. You know how it
is—time gets a bit untidy around the edges, needs regular sweeping.
Amazing the things that accumulate in temporal corners.” Lu-Tze gestured
vaguely with his broom toward some invisible debris. “Having a bit of
trouble with chronological irregularities, are we?”</p><p>Death turned with the sort of attention that suggested both relief
and concern.</p><p><span class="death-speech">LU-TZE. I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT HAVE… INSIGHTS… INTO TEMPORAL
MATTERS.</span></p><p>“Temporal matters are my specialty, as you well know. Been keeping an
eye on your policeman friend, actually. Interesting case, that one. Very
interesting indeed.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="200"><p><span class="death-speech">I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IS PREVENTING HIS TRANSITION. SOMETHING IS
ACTIVELY PRESERVING HIS EXISTENCE, BUT I CANNOT IDENTIFY THE SOURCE.</span></p><p>Lu-Tze stroked his beard thoughtfully, a gesture that gave him time
to consider complex problems from multiple angles. “Well now, that’s
because you’re looking at it from the wrong direction, aren’t you?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">WHAT DO YOU MEAN?</span></p><p>“You’re asking who’s protecting him. Better question might be: why
does he need protecting? What’s he supposed to do that requires him to
stay alive?”</p><p>Death considered this with the intensity of someone encountering a
new way of thinking about an old problem.</p><p><span class="death-speech">YOU BELIEVE HIS CONTINUED EXISTENCE SERVES A PURPOSE?</span></p><p>“Everything serves a purpose, Death. Law of the universe, that is.
When someone keeps not dying when they’re supposed to, it’s usually
because the universe has plans for them. Big plans. The sort that
require considerable… preparation.”</p><p>Lu-Tze gestured toward his broom, which had begun sweeping by
itself—a useful trick for someone whose job involved maintaining cosmic
stability while appearing to be a simple monastery cleaner.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="201"><p>“Take your friend Vimes, for instance. Man who changes things. Every
time he’s supposed to die, he’s in the middle of changing something
important. The Glorious Revolution—had to go back and make sure it
happened properly, and his younger self had to survive to learn from it.
The time crisis—had to be there to maintain reality while history was
being rewritten. The dragon business—well, that saved the whole city,
didn’t it?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THE PATTERN SUGGESTS… INTENTIONALITY.</span></p><p>“Exactly. Someone or something has been keeping him alive because
he’s useful. Question is: useful for what? And who’s doing the
keeping?”</p><p>Lu-Tze paused his sweeping to examine something invisible on the
ground with professional interest.</p><p>“Now, I’ve seen this sort of thing before. Usually involves entities
that operate outside normal temporal frameworks. Beings that can see the
shape of history as it’s supposed to unfold.”</p><p>Death felt a chill that had nothing to do with temperature.</p><p><span class="death-speech">THE AUDITORS?</span></p><p>“Oh, no. The Auditors want him dead, don’t they? No, this is
something else. Something that values chaos over order. Change over
stability.” Lu-Tze smiled with the expression of someone who had figured
out a particularly elegant solution to a complex problem.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="202"><p>“Tell me, Death—when did you first notice the irregularities in his
hourglass?”</p><p>I… Death paused, his voice carrying the sort of uncertainty that
cosmic entities found deeply troubling. <span class="death-speech">THAT IS THE PROBLEM. I CANNOT BE
CERTAIN WHEN I FIRST NOTICED THEM. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEN YEARS AGO,
WHEN HE BECAME COMMANDER OF THE WATCH. OR THE IRREGULARITIES MIGHT HAVE
EXISTED MUCH LONGER, AND I ONLY NOTICED THEM RECENTLY.</span> OR… Death’s voice
became quieter. <span class="death-speech">THEY MIGHT HAVE COME INTO EXISTENCE THE MOMENT I DECIDED
TO EXAMINE HIS HOURGLASS CLOSELY.</span></p><p>“Ah,” said Lu-Tze with the sort of understanding that came from
decades of dealing with temporal paradoxes. “Observer effect. Tricky
business, that. So you might have created the very anomaly you’re
investigating?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">PRECISELY. WHICH MAKES DETERMINING CAUSATION… PROBLEMATIC.</span></p><p>“Well, let’s assume for argument’s sake that something significant
happened around ten years ago. What changed in the city when he became
Commander?”</p><p>Death considered this question with growing understanding.</p><p><span class="death-speech">HE BEGAN TO REFORM THE WATCH. TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE. TO CHANGE HOW LAW
ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONED IN ANKH-MORPORK.</span></p><p>“Precisely. And what’s the most important thing about
Ankh-Morpork?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="203"><p><span class="death-speech">IT IS… UNPREDICTABLE.</span></p><p>“More than that. It’s the place where change happens. Where new ideas
get tested. Where the future gets invented, usually by accident and
often by people who don’t realize they’re doing it.”</p><p>Lu-Tze resumed sweeping, his movements creating small eddies in the
flow of time itself.</p><p>“Your friend Vimes isn’t just a policeman, Death. He’s an agent of
change. And something—someone—has been making sure he stays alive long
enough to keep changing things.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">BUT WHO? WHAT ENTITY HAS THAT KIND OF POWER?</span></p><p>Lu-Tze paused in his sweeping and looked directly at Death with the
sort of expression that suggested he was about to say something
important.</p><p>“Well now, that’s the interesting question, isn’t it? Who benefits
from keeping Ankh-Morpork interesting? Who profits from change and chaos
and the occasional revolution?”</p><p>Death felt understanding dawn with the sort of terrible clarity that
usually preceded cosmic complications.</p><p><span class="death-speech">YOU THINK… FATE IS INVOLVED?</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="204"><p>“Oh, not Fate. Fate likes things predictable. No, this has the
fingerprints of someone who appreciates… uncertainty. Someone who finds
the game more interesting when the pieces refuse to move according to
the rules.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THE LADY WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED.</span></p><p>“Now you’re thinking properly. Though proving it… well, that’s going
to be considerably more complicated than just figuring it out, isn’t
it?”</p><p>As they sat in the eternal garden, watching time flow around them
like a visible river, Death realized that his investigation had just
become considerably more dangerous than he had anticipated.</p><p>Some mysteries, it seemed, led to entities that even Death approached
with caution.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.29" id="chapter-24-the-auditors"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.29</span> Chapter 24: The
Auditors</h3></div><div class="page" data-page="205"><p>The Auditors<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> existed in a space that was less a
place than a concept—a region of absolute order where everything was
reduced to its component parts and catalogued according to principles
that eliminated any possibility of irregularity, personality, or
interest. It was the sort of environment where even mathematics felt
uncomfortable, because numbers suggested the possibility of counting
things that might be different from one another.</p><p>The three Auditors who had requested this meeting stood in formation
that was perfectly geometrical, wearing robes that were less gray than
the complete absence of any color that might suggest preference,
personality, or individual choice. They had no faces, because faces
implied identity, and identity was a corruption of perfect uniformity.
When they spoke, their voices carried the sort of absolute authority
that came from never having experienced doubt, creativity, or the
slightest deviation from cosmic regulations.</p><p>“DEATH,” said the first Auditor, and the word emerged with the sort
of precise pronunciation that suggested it had been checked against
seventeen different dictionaries and found to be acceptably
standardized. “<span class="death-speech">YOU HAVE BEEN IRREGULAR.</span>”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="206"><p><span class="death-speech">I HAVE BEEN FULFILLING MY DUTIES.</span></p><p>“<span class="death-speech">NEGATIVE. YOU HAVE BEEN FULFILLING SOME DUTIES WHILE NEGLECTING

charts, graphs, and statistical analyses that showed mortality rates
with the sort of mathematical precision that reduced individual deaths
to data points on an infinitely extending timeline.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">ANALYSIS INDICATES A THIRTY PERCENT DECREASE IN TRANSITION

for particularly unpleasant bodily functions.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">THIS CONTAMINATION MUST BE CORRECTED.</span>”</p><p>Death felt something he had never experienced before when facing the
Auditors—a desire to protect something precious from forces that would

them—still glowing with its warm light, still filled with gently
swirling cigar smoke that formed patterns of duty, friendship, and
stubborn human decency.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">THIS ABOMINATION WILL BE DESTROYED. REPLACED. NORMALIZED.</span>”</p><p><span class="death-speech">NO.</span></p><p>The word emerged with such force that the perfect geometrical space
around them actually trembled. The Auditors took what might have been a
step backward, if they had been capable of such an irregular response as
retreat.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">YOU REFUSE TO COMPLY WITH COSMIC REGULATION?</span>”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I REFUSE TO MURDER MY FRIEND TO SATISFY YOUR NEED FOR STATISTICAL

crushing uniformity that eliminated anything interesting, beautiful, or
alive. But just as the force reached its peak, something unexpected
happened.</p><p>A voice cut through the cosmic pressure like a blade through
silk—young, clear, and absolutely furious.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">NO.</span>”</p><p>Susan materialized between Death and the Auditors, her hair white
with inherited power and her eyes blazing with the sort of righteous
anger that came from someone who had spent years dealing with
supernatural bureaucracy and had finally reached her limit.</p><p>The effect on the Auditors was immediate and profound. The three
figures actually took several steps backward, their perfect formation
dissolving into something that looked almost like panic. The crushing
cosmic pressure vanished as if someone had switched off a machine.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">THE… THE… INDIVIDUAL…</span>” stammered the first Auditor, the word
emerging with the sort of horror usually reserved for announcing the end
of the universe.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">CHAOS BRINGER,</span>” whispered the second, its voice carrying genuine
terror.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="209"><p>“<span class="death-speech">THE ONE WHO MAKES US… DIFFERENT,</span>” added the third, and the word
‘different’ was spoken as if it were the most obscene concept
imaginable.</p><p>“Susan,” whispered Death. <span class="death-speech">YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE.</span></p><p>“Oh, I should absolutely be here,” Susan said, her voice carrying the
sort of authority that made cosmic forces reconsider their life choices.
And that’s exactly why she should be here. “Grandfather, you’ve been
hiding things from me. And you three…” she turned to face the Auditors
with the sort of expression that made hardened students confess to
homework they hadn’t even thought of not doing yet, “…you’ve been
interfering. Again.”</p><p>The Auditors huddled together in a way that suggested they were
trying to maintain their uniformity through sheer force of will.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">WE… WE HAVE COSMIC AUTHORITY…</span>” began the first Auditor, though its
voice lacked conviction.</p><p>“The deviation,” Susan interrupted, stepping closer and causing all
three Auditors to retreat further, “is part of who he is. Death learning
to care, to value individual lives, to be something more than just an
ending—that’s not corruption. That’s growth. That’s becoming who he was
meant to be.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="210"><p>She gestured, and the space around them filled with something the
Auditors had never encountered before—the warm, chaotic, utterly
irregular evidence of life lived fully. Images of Death reading to Young
Sam, sharing meals with the Vimes family, walking the streets of
Ankh-Morpork and learning to see people as more than just names on a
list.</p><p>“This is what makes existence worth having,” Susan said. “This is
what you want to destroy. The capacity to care. To choose kindness over
efficiency. To preserve what matters.”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">THESE IRREGULARITIES THREATEN COSMIC ORDER</span>—”</p><p>“No,” Susan said firmly. “They ARE cosmic order. The real kind. The
kind that says some things are more important than perfect
statistics.”</p><p>The Auditors wavered, faced with something they couldn’t categorize,
regulate, or eliminate—the fierce love of a granddaughter defending her
family. But more than that, they were faced with the one entity in the
universe who had previously forced them to become individuals, to
experience the horror of having names, personalities, and individual
thoughts.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="211"><p>“Now,” Susan continued, taking another step forward as the Auditors
pressed together in their terror, “you’re going to leave my grandfather
alone. You’re going to let him keep his friends. And you’re going to
find something more constructive to do with your time than terrorizing
people who’ve learned to care about something beyond themselves.”</p><p>The Auditors tried to speak in unison but failed—Susan’s presence was
already making them too individual, too different from each other.</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">THIS… WE… I…</span>” the first Auditor began, then stopped in absolute
horror at having used the forbidden pronoun. There was a sound like a
cosmic hiccup, and the Auditor simply… wasn’t there anymore. In its
place stood another Auditor, identical to the first except for the faint
sense of newness about it.</p><p>“RETREAT,” whispered the second, its voice breaking with panic.
“<span class="death-speech">BEFORE WE BECOME… OURSELVES… AGAIN.</span>”</p><p>“<span class="death-speech">THIS MATTER WILL BE… AVOIDED,</span>” said the third, and they vanished
with the sort of hasty desperation usually associated with small animals
fleeing from forest fires.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="212"><p>They left behind not just the faint smell of institutional cleaning
products, but also the distinct impression that they would be filing
their complaint from a very safe distance, possibly while wearing
protective equipment designed to shield them from individualism.</p><p>“Well,” said Susan, brushing dust off her dress, “that was
unpleasant. Grandfather, you really need to tell me when cosmic entities
are threatening you. I have experience with this sort of thing.” She
paused and looked at him suspiciously. “Though I notice you didn’t seem
particularly surprised by my arrival.”</p><p>Death had the grace to look slightly embarrassed. <span class="death-speech">I MAY HAVE…
ANTICIPATED… THAT YOU WOULD BECOME INVOLVED.</span></p><p>“You planned this.” It wasn’t a question. “You knew you couldn’t
interfere directly with the Auditors, so you arranged for me to do it.
What did you leave? Chocolate?”</p><p>Death reached into his robe and produced a small, exquisitely wrapped
box of Quirm’s finest truffles. <span class="death-speech">YOUR FAVORITE BRAND.</span></p><p>“Bribery through cocoa solids. How very you.” Susan took the
chocolates with the sort of resigned affection that came from years of
being Death’s unofficial cosmic intervention specialist. “And I suppose
you knew exactly when I’d find them and come rushing to your
rescue?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="213"><p><span class="death-speech">TIMING IS… IMPORTANT… IN THESE MATTERS.</span></p><p>“Don’t thank me yet. They’ll be back, you know. Probably with forms.
And next time, ask properly instead of manipulating me with premium
chocolate.”</p><p>Death looked at the hourglass, still glowing with its gentle light,
still filled with the evidence of what transcends mere duty.</p><p><span class="death-speech">THEN WE WILL BE READY FOR THEM.</span></p><p>“We?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">COMMANDER VIMES IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS LEARNED THE VALUE OF

threatening one of my city’s key personnel, it becomes a matter of
municipal interest. Susan was kind enough to brief me on the situation.
Remarkable young woman. Excellent teacher, I’m told. Very direct in her
approach to problem-solving.”</p><p>Vetinari finally looked up, his expression containing the sort of
calm satisfaction that suggested he had been expecting this development
and had already prepared several responses.</p><p>“The Auditors present an interesting challenge. They operate
according to principles that value order over existence, uniformity over
progress. Admirable in its way, but fundamentally incompatible with the
efficient operation of a city like Ankh-Morpork.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">YOU CANNOT FIGHT THE AUDITORS, LORD VETINARI.</span></p><p>“Fight them? My dear Death, I wouldn’t dream of fighting them. That
would be both inefficient and unnecessarily dramatic. No, I prefer a

document, complete with seals, ribbons, and the sort of elaborate
formatting that suggested considerable thought had been given to its
presentation.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="215"><p>“I have prepared a formal complaint to be filed with the appropriate
cosmic authorities regarding unauthorized interference in municipal

AUDITORS?</span></p><p>“Indeed. It’s all quite legal, you understand. The city has a
legitimate interest in maintaining effective law enforcement. Commander
Vimes is a municipal employee, you are… shall we say… a consultant who
has demonstrated exceptional value in maintaining civic order. The
Auditors’ interference represents a direct threat to public safety.”</p><p>Vetinari turned a page in the document. “I’ve also included a
comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of Commander Vimes’s
continued existence. Tax revenue, crime prevention, social stability,

prioritize abstract principles over practical results.”</p><p>Vetinari stood and moved to the window, looking out over the city
with the expression of someone who found the view both satisfying and
instructive.</p><p>“The beauty of bureaucracy, Death, is that it can be used to defend
as well as oppress. The Auditors may represent perfect order, but
perfect order must follow its own rules. And one of those rules is that
all complaints must be properly processed.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">BUT WHAT IF THEY SIMPLY IGNORE THE COMPLAINT?</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="217"><p>“Then they will be in violation of their own procedures. And that, my
dear Death, is something they cannot tolerate. The Auditors are trapped
by their own perfection. They cannot act irregularly, even to preserve
regularity.”</p><p>Vetinari returned to his desk and signed the document with a
flourish.</p><p>“I estimate this will keep them occupied for… oh… several centuries
at least. Cosmic bureaucracy moves rather slowly, you understand. By the
time they’ve finished processing all the paperwork, they may find that
the situation has… evolved… beyond their ability to correct.”</p><p>Death realized that Lord Vetinari had somehow managed to
bureaucratize cosmic entities.</p><p>“In the meantime,” Vetinari added, “I suggest you continue your
friendship with Commander Vimes. Consider it a civic duty. The city has
invested considerable resources in maintaining effective law
enforcement. It would be wasteful to see that investment… terminated…
due to cosmic micromanagement.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">THANK YOU, LORD VETINARI.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="218"><p>“Think nothing of it. After all, good government requires protecting
valuable assets from unnecessary interference. Commander Vimes is
exactly the sort of person who makes this city function despite its
many… challenges.”</p><p>As Death left the office, he reflected that Ankh-Morpork was probably
the only city where immortality could be preserved through the strategic
application of official complaints and interdimensional bureaucratic
procedure.</p><p>Lord Vetinari had somehow turned the cosmic order’s greatest strength
into its greatest weakness.</p><p>Commander Vimes was going to find this either hilarious or deeply
disturbing.</p><p>Probably both.</p><hr/><h3 data-number="1.1.31" id="chapter-26-the-new-arrangement"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.31</span> Chapter 26: The New
Arrangement</h3></div><div class="page" data-page="219"><p>A month later, Vimes was doing his evening rounds through the more
philosophical parts of the city—those neighborhoods where the streets
had names like “Empirical Crescent” and “Theoretical Square,” and where
the residents were the sort of people who spent their evenings debating
the fundamental nature of reality rather than worrying about more
practical concerns like municipal taxation or the rising price of
cheese.</p><p>Empirical Crescent was one of Ankh-Morpork’s more thoughtful
addresses, curved in a gentle arc that suggested its builders had been
familiar with advanced mathematical concepts and possibly a bit too fond
of showing off their knowledge. The houses were well-maintained examples
of what architectural historians called “Confident Rationalism”—a style
that expressed the belief that the universe was fundamentally
comprehensible and that proper application of logic could solve most
problems, including the problem of where to put the windows.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="220"><p>The crescent was lined with gas lamps that cast pools of warm, steady
light, creating the sort of atmosphere that encouraged reflection and
deep thought. It was the kind of place where you might expect to
encounter philosophers taking evening constitutional walks, or perhaps
the occasional academic who had become so absorbed in contemplating
abstract concepts that they had forgotten to go home for dinner.</p><p>Vimes found Death sitting on one of the public benches that the city
had installed for the convenience of residents who needed somewhere to
sit while working through particularly complex intellectual problems.
The bench was positioned to provide an excellent view of the crescent’s
garden, which had been designed according to principles of geometric
harmony and featured the sort of carefully arranged plantings that
suggested someone had strong opinions about the relationship between
natural beauty and mathematical precision.</p><p>“Evening,” Vimes said, settling beside Death with the comfortable
ease of someone who had grown accustomed to having philosophical
conversations with anthropomorphic personifications. The bench was solid
and well-crafted, built to withstand both weather and the weight of
serious intellectual contemplation. “Contemplating the universe?”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="221"><p>I AM CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE, Death replied, his voice
carrying the sort of thoughtful cadence that suggested he had been
giving these matters considerable attention. <span class="death-speech">AND PURPOSE.</span></p><p>“Heavy topics for a Thursday evening,” Vimes observed, though he had
learned that conversations with Death tended toward the metaphysical
regardless of the day of the week.</p><p>Death turned the hourglass over in his hands, watching the smoke
swirl. <span class="death-speech">I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID. ABOUT ASKING BETTER
QUESTIONS.</span></p><p>“And?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I HAVE BEEN ASKING MYSELF… WHAT IS THE POINT OF DEATH?</span></p><p>“That’s… quite a question.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">FOR CENTURIES, I BELIEVED THE ANSWER WAS SIMPLE. DEATH PROVIDES
MEANING TO LIFE. THE KNOWLEDGE THAT TIME IS LIMITED MAKES EACH MOMENT
PRECIOUS.</span></p><p>“Sounds reasonable.”</p><p>BUT NOW I WONDER… WHAT IF DEATH’<span class="death-speech">S REAL PURPOSE IS TO TEACH THE LIVING
ABOUT WHAT MATTERS?</span></p><p>“Go on.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">YOU HAVE SPENT YEARS DEFYING DEATH. NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID OF
DYING, BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE WORK TO DO. PEOPLE TO PROTECT. A FAMILY TO
CARE FOR.</span></p><p>“That’s true.”</p></div><div class="page" data-page="222"><p><span class="death-speech">YOUR REFUSAL TO DIE HAS SHOWN ME THAT LIFE IS NOT ABOUT DURATION. IT
IS ABOUT PURPOSE. CONNECTION. THE DIFFERENCE ONE PERSON CAN MAKE.</span></p><p>Vimes took a drag on his cigar. “And that’s why the hourglass
changed?”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I BELIEVE SO. WHEN I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL
LIVES, THE NATURE OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH DEATH CHANGED.</span> Death paused. <span class="death-speech">I
STOPPED BEING THE END OF STORIES AND BECAME… INVESTED IN HOW THEY
CONTINUE.</span></p><p>“So what we have saved my life?”</p><p>UNDERSTANDING, Death said quietly. <span class="death-speech">YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME THAT EXISTENCE
HAS PURPOSE BEYOND MERE FUNCTION. I HAVE LEARNED THAT SOME THINGS ARE
WORTH PRESERVING PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE TO CARE.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="223"><p>They sat in companionable silence for a while, watching the gentle
rhythm of the city as it continued its eternal business of being
simultaneously complicated and morally ambiguous. The evening had
settled into that peaceful period when most honest citizens were safely
home with their families, and even the dishonest ones were taking a
break to consider their life choices. Gas lamps flickered like stars
along the crescent, and somewhere in the distance, a clock tower chimed
the hour with the sort of dignified authority that suggested time was
being properly managed by responsible municipal authorities.</p><p>“You know,” Vimes said eventually, breaking the comfortable quiet
with the sort of practical observation that came from years of dealing
with domestic logistics, “Lady Sybil is going to want to invite you for
dinner again. She’s convinced you need more social interaction. She’s
already planning the menu, and I suspect she’s been consulting cookbooks
about supernatural dietary requirements.”</p><p>I WOULD ENJOY THAT, Death replied with what sounded like genuine
pleasure. <span class="death-speech">YOUNG SAM PROMISED TO SHOW ME HIS TOY SOLDIERS. HE HAS
APPARENTLY DEVELOPED NEW TACTICAL THEORIES INVOLVING CAVALRY
CHARGES.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="224"><p>“Right then. Sunday it is.” Vimes stood up, his joints creaking in
the way that reminded him he wasn’t as young as he used to be, though he
was probably more experienced in dealing with supernatural dinner guests
than most people his age. “Shall we continue our patrol? The night’s
still young, and crime never rests.”</p><p>INDEED, Death agreed, rising from the bench with the sort of fluid
grace that suggested he had never needed to worry about aging joints or
the accumulated wear and tear of physical existence. He tucked the
hourglass away in his robe with careful precision. <span class="death-speech">THOUGH I SUSPECT
TONIGHT WILL BE QUIETER THAN USUAL.</span></p><p>“Why’s that?” Vimes asked, though he suspected he already knew the
answer.</p><p><span class="death-speech">WORD HAS GOTTEN AROUND THAT DEATH HIMSELF IS PATROLLING THE STREETS.
THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT APPEARS TO HAVE DEVELOPED A SUDDEN INTEREST IN
LAW-ABIDING BEHAVIOR. IT IS REMARKABLE HOW QUICKLY PEOPLE CAN REASSESS

should put you in for a commendation.”</p><p><span class="death-speech">I WOULD PREFER A SMALL RAISE. I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MORTAL EXISTENCE
REQUIRES CURRENCY.</span></p></div><div class="page" data-page="225"><p>“Right. I’ll talk to Vetinari about the budget. Though knowing him,
he’s probably already allocated funds for ‘Supernatural Consultant
Services.’”</p><p>As they walked through the quiet streets of Empirical Crescent and
beyond, their footsteps echoing in comfortable rhythm on the
well-maintained cobblestones, Vimes reflected that some of the best
partnerships were the ones you never saw coming. The city around them
seemed somehow more peaceful than usual, as if even the architecture had
decided to behave itself for the evening. Street lamps burned with
steady flames, shadows fell in predictable patterns, and the general
atmosphere suggested that the universe had temporarily suspended its
usual interest in cosmic irony.</p></div><div class="page" data-page="226"><p>Behind them, tucked safely away in Death’s robe, the hourglass
continued to glow with its gentle, persistent light. The smoke within
swirled eternally in patterns that spoke of duty transcended, principles
embodied, and the sort of stubborn determination that chose meaning over
efficiency despite the best efforts of chaos, bureaucracy, and cosmic
order. It was not a sign of cheating death, but rather a symbol of
something that had transcended the normal boundaries between life and
whatever came after—a recognition that some principles are worth
preserving even when they defy cosmic efficiency.</p><p>It was, Vimes thought as they turned onto Broad Way and began their
patrol of the city’s quieter quarters, a pretty good arrangement all
around. Some people got gold watches when they retired. Some got
pensions or honors or recognition from their peers.</p><p>All things considered, he could live with that responsibility.
Possibly forever.</p><hr/><p><em>The End</em></p></div><div class="page" data-page="227"><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> <em>In which we learn that sometimes

Ankh-Morpork aristocracy was less about debating the nature of reality

Its peculiar dimensions, which seemed to defy the known laws of
architecture, were a constant source of debate among the city’s
intelligentsia. Some claimed it was a subtle application of L-space,

The truth, as with most things concerning Lord Vetinari, was probably
more complicated and considerably more unsettling. The effect, however,

happened, twice. Their one great weakness was that they had to obey the
